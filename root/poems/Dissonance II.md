And so, <br>
he shot a breath from the abyss;
an ambitious taste of horror, 
presence-seeking, but a miss.

[align=right]
That is all I am?  <br>
A shot in the dark!  
Miss me, 
won't you?

[align=left]
Miss?<br>
Won't you let me give you everything? 
I gift my passion, starless voids,  
silence in a world fraught with noise.

[align=right]
But I do not want any of your toys <br>
lest willpower be material. <br>
Love is not an object, 
it's your nature that's imperial. 
Nor are emotions dead, property, 
so speak with peace, properly, 
or, by God, nothing's stopping me
from leaving this all here!

[align=left]
Stop you? <br>
Nothing ever does, 
it's on and on, 
infinity and beyond. 
It's back and forth,
south and north, 
your voice is like 
a mountain's worth.

[align=right]
A mountain is all you value me? <br>
I have walked the roads of radiant suns.
I have dreamt within a dream, 
and in that dreamscape, 
I saw that you were nothing to me. 
I might thank my trails and journeys 
for defining my way... 
if I didn't pray myself to sleep each night, 
the nightmare lives in day. 
Yet still, you wield empty memories... 
you care for what's not there. 
So, yes, you will remember me 
from above the mean 
while I forget all but your story's theme.

[align=left]
Never will you see balance. <br>

[align=right]
And youâ€¦ <br>
you will only see malice, 
unless our powers are forever tied, I deem. 
So, must I beg the question... 
and its answer?
It's your desires, death dancer; 
they are consistently obscene. 
Though I am of no surprise; 
you are repetitious, 
made out like machine. 
You did what you did, 
and you hid it; 
surreptitious. 
It is of you I am clean.

[align=left]
I come from cold erasure, <br>
I take what fuels I lack!
I deserve to burn brighter than night; 
not one more moment shall I slack!
Life may be your comfort, 
but these patterns are my keepsakes, 
repetition, my safety! 
You may stare, just as you are, 
it's true. 
I am the forsaken dream, 
the mare, the deep blue. 
I am what gives a lion his mane, 
the bear, the song nobody sings you. 
I am an introspective glare, the maim, 
a puppetmaster, masking every truth. 
I am he who dare claim the dragon's lair. 
My name? 
Ego's lack of shame, 
title, Truthsayer.
So, I'll stay busy, 
obsessed with more. 
As in the end, 
I'll be the player 
and the highest score. 
The idol, the prayer 
leading people to death's door. 
Oh, this desire... 
it desires for more!

[align=center]
It is a black game, <br>
that much I am sure.
