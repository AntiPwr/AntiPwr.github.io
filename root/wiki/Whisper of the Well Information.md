<summary><h3>Merchant System</h3></summary>

The <a href="Merchant System.md">Merchant System</a> encompasses a grouping of belief-based magic frameworks within the Toman Ecoss, including <a href="Source Surges.md">Source Surges</a>, <a href="Discovery Inspiration.md">Discovery Inspiration</a>, and <a href="Sea Level Spells.md">Sea Level Spells</a>. Its purpose is to let characters harness the power of their beliefs, translating them into tangible abilities that enhance both roleplay and narrative immersion.

**Source Surges**:  
- *Passive Surges*: Natural events triggered by overlapping belief spheres, often influenced by powerful entities or religious Orders. Examples include spontaneous growth of roots from a druid’s grief, or a fighter feeling sudden renewed vigor.
- **Controlled Surges**: Intentional activations of belief by channeling on personal "Claims"—aspects of a character’s faith, virtues, purpose, oaths, and connections.

**Claims**:  
Represent core aspects of a character (Faith, Virtue, Purpose, Oath, Connection). Once all are filled, players can coordinate with the DM to form an avatar of their belief, a manifestation of their ideals given tangible form.

**Restorative Meditation**:  
After using a controlled surge, a character must rest for a week or meditate to restore their abilities. Daily meditative practices speed recovery, each hour of meditation reduces downtime by a day.

**Discovery Inspiration**:  
Replaces traditional DMG Inspiration. By achieving personal milestones, uncovering truths, or fulfilling goals, players earn dice of varying sizes (D4 to D20). Lesser dice (D4–D12) resemble Bardic Inspiration and must be used quickly, while a D20 represents a major milestone and can be saved between sessions.

**Sea Level Spells**:  
A unique, soul-attuned spell or ability—highly personal and reflective of the character’s essence. This is not available at the start of the game.

**Flow State & Stagnant State**:  
- *Flow State*: A meditative state representing perfect alignment of focus.
- *Stagnant State*: A contrasting meditative approach with different narrative implications.

This section highlights key historical periods, locations, belief systems, and metaphysical structures shaping Toma and its inhabitants.

<summary><h3>Purpose Taxonomy</h3></summary>

<a href="Purpose Taxonomy.md">Purpose Taxonomy</a> is an ancient classification system that categorizes existence, guiding understanding of souls, belief, and governance:

- <a href="Eco.md">Eco</a> (Plane) (Theoretical)  
- <a href="Kingdom.md">Kingdom</a> (Inhabitant)  
- <a href="Phylum.md">Phylum</a> (Ideology)  
- <a href="Class.md">Class</a> (Government)  
- <a href="Order.md">Order</a> (Civilization)  
- <a href="Family.md">Family</a> (Community)  
- <a href="Essa.md">Essa</a> (Soul’s Purpose) (Theoretical)

<summary><h3>Historical Understanding</h3></summary>

Toma’s timeline is divided into Lines, each concluding with a rotation shift of the <a href="World Gyre.md">World Gyre</a>:

- <a href="Taxotheir Line.md">Taxotheir Line</a>: Marked by the formation of early governance, intense conflict over Hollow Resources, and the beginnings of structured Purpose Taxonomy. Rivalries like Esterik vs. Scepitath define this era.
  
- <a href="Cel Blindbirth Line.md">Cel Blindbirth Line</a>: Following the Taxotheir Line’s devastation, Celia and Primordials quickly began to dominate the overground. Huma populations slowly became the crossfire for a war between these kingdoms, forcing Huma societies to reposition underground as the conflicts ramped up. During this time in the subterrain, the Huma population fell steadily, falling to just 4% of the original population before bouncing back in the next line.  This era’s horrors reshaped society, setting the stage for future recoveries.
  
- <a href="Line from Few.md">Line from Few</a>: After emerging from subterranean refuges as Celia’s dominance waned, survivors reclaimed surface regions. Societies like Sol Unita (from Scepitath) and the Branches of Concordia (from Esterik) formed, establishing new balances of faith, trade, and governance.

<a href="Asath.md">Asath</a>., the Eye, is a worshipped Nesa, or god, that guides Asceptim and his followers. Asath's rise of influence began alongside the <a href="Line from Few">Line from Few</a>, causing the development of the <a href="Rites of Huma.md">Rites of Huma</a>, contained in <a href="Ester Slate.md">Ester Slates</a>. These rites are religious governing documents that influence policy and spiritual practices in Sol Unita.

**Example: a few Rites of Huma**:  
- *Rite of Passage*: The foundational journey from ignorance to enlightenment.  
- *Rite of Decomposition*: Acceptance of impermanence and understanding life’s cyclical nature.  
- *Rite of Rule*: Guidance for leaders, channeling ancestral wisdom for just governance.

<summary><h3>Hollow Resources</h3></summary>

Hollow Resources are vital materials formed from the transformative breakdown of matter, leaving behind potent substances. These resources fuel technology, spiritual practices, and entire economies.

**Examples**:  
- **Photometal**: Stores and imprints beliefs under light exposure.   
- **Primma**: From Celia’s decomposition process, purity reflecting ascension proximity. Hardens with moisture, maintaining property pride and stewardship.  
- **Aprima**: Pure form of Primma used in most of the infrastructure, revered in Sol Unita culture.

These resources underlie societal advancements, often causing power struggles. Throughout the game you will learn of more resources than those shown here.

<summary><h3>Concordia and the Branches of Concordia</h3></summary>

<a href="Concordia">Concordia</a> is a continent governed by the <a href="Branches of Concordia">Branches of Concordia</a>, a government formed around hereditary meritocracy and strict cultural values. Emerging after the fall of Esterik during the Taxotheir and Cel Blindbirth Lines, the Branches forged new roots of governance in the values of unity, cultural heritage, and economic resilience at the start of the line.

Two polarized factions, the <a href="Seos Ofshut">Seos Ofshut</a> and the <a href="Leiflan Ofshut">Leiflan Ofshut</a>, shape Concordia’s political climate. Seos push for foreign trade and expansion, while Leiflan favor isolationism and cultural conservation. Resources like Lichen Pearls and Corlin Trees support both economic and spiritual life, with cities like the capital order of Kaina and the military port city of Be'him holding strategic and historical significance. The Sedl Continental Army exemplifies Concordia’s collective defense and regional pride.

The polarization and political turmoil was a result of the years following the War of Conclusions, with the era being remembered in Concordian culture as the "<a href="Driftwood Nightmare">Driftwood Nightmare</a>". This war was between the Scepitath (now Sol Unita) and the Branches of Concordia, started on the 267th year of the Line from Few and lasting 37 years. You will learn more about these events in game.
