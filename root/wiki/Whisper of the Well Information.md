# Campaign 1: Whispers of the Well

<details open>
<summary><h2>Introduction</h2></summary>

Welcome to the Campaign 1 Information page. This guide exists in two parts. For the current sessions of campaign 1, see "II.".

This resource, similar to the rest of the wiki, reflects the collective knowledge of the party. The world and its mechanics will evolve alongside player growth and feedback through iterative updates to this site following in-person sessions.

<summary><h2>I. First Arc</h2></summary>

The First Arc introduced the original "party" of adventurers. Their journey began in [[Scender]] and ended north of [[Goblbrook]] in the [[Jeti Sound]] with Lavinho and Mel splitting off from Laika.

<summary><h3>Campaign Information</h3></summary>

The campaign will be called, <a href="Whisper of the Well.html">Whisper of the Well</a>, taking place within the eco/plane of <a href="Toma.html">Toma</a>. Although, as seen with the name of the wiki, the <a href="Scape.html">Scape</a> is the name of the universe. Currently, the significance of the Scape remains undiscovered. For more background information on the world, see <a href="#World Information">World Information</a>.

<summary><h3>Unlock System</h3></summary>

The <a href="Unlock System.html">Unlock System</a> slowly introduces new homebrew classes, spells, and races as the party progresses. Once unlocked, these options will be available to all.

<summary><h3>Will</h3></summary>

<a href="Will.html">Will</a>  (**WIL**) represents the intangible reserve of self-determination, mental fortitude, and spiritual vitality that shields a creature's identity from external corruption—especially psychic parasites, fungal hive-minds, and masterful manipulation. It measures how well a being can maintain its own thought patterns, beliefs, knowledge, and loyalties in the face of subtle or forceful mental intrusion. This number will be higher than your other main stats, but that is because it does not reflect rolls, but rather a mental health pool that protects you from permanent belief changes such as mindlessness or ideological subversion. Certain kingdoms have evolved to influence will, as seen with [[Inoculation]].

**Maximum WIL = CON + STR + DEX + WIS + INT + CHA + PB**

<summary><h3>Merchant System</h3></summary>

The <a href="Merchant System.html">Merchant System</a> encompasses a grouping of belief-based magic frameworks within the Toman Ecoss, including <a href="Source Surge.html">Source Surges</a>, <a href="Discovery Inspiration.html">Discovery Inspiration</a>, and <a href="Sea Level Spell.html">Sea Level Spells</a>. Its purpose is to let characters harness the power of their beliefs, translating them into tangible abilities that enhance both roleplay and narrative immersion.

**Source Surges**:  
- **Passive Surges**: Natural events triggered by overlapping belief spheres, often influenced by powerful entities or religious Orders. Examples include spontaneous growth of roots from a druid's grief, or a fighter feeling sudden renewed vigor.
- **Controlled Surges**: Intentional activations of belief by channeling on personal "Claims"—aspects of a character's faith, virtues, purpose, oaths, and connections.

**Claims**:  
Represent core aspects of a character (Faith, Virtue, Purpose, Oath, Connection). Once all are filled, players can coordinate with the DM to form an avatar of their belief, a manifestation of their ideals given tangible form.

**Restorative Meditation**:  
After using a controlled surge, a character must rest for a week or meditate to restore their abilities. Daily meditative practices speed recovery, each hour of meditation reduces downtime by a day.

**Flow State & Stagnant State**:  
- *Flow State*: A meditative state representing peak alignment of focus. In this state, you gain +1 to any stat but CON. You have advantage on any check with the stat you chose for the duration of flow state.
- *Stagnant State*: A contrasting meditative approach of non-judgement and void. In this state, you gain +1 WIS while in this state. Creatures have advantage to hit you in this state. 

**Discovery Inspiration**:  
Replaces traditional DMG Inspiration. By achieving personal milestones, uncovering truths, or fulfilling goals, players earn dice of varying sizes (D4 to D20). Lesser dice (D4–D12) resemble Bardic Inspiration and must be used quickly, while a D20 represents a major milestone and can be saved between sessions.

**Sea Level Spells**:  
A unique, soul-attuned spell or ability—highly personal and reflective of the character's essence. This is not available at the start of the game.

<summary><h4>Anim and Belief</h3></summary>

[[Anim]] is mana-adjacent resource within the magic system of Toma. It is thought of as existing in three distinct states:

1. Anima (Externalized, or Outputted Anim)
2. Animus (Internalized, or Inputted Anim)
3. [[Belief]] (Untapped State)

Although belief is actually a potential state of Anim, its differences to the other states grant it emphasis and a unique name in arcane fields of study.

<details open>
<summary><h4>Anim Illnesses, Belief Afflicts</h3></summary>

Belief Afflicts or affliction influence and manifest in a creature's perception and consciousness, whereas Anim Illnesses physically effects the creature. However, belief afflicts are special because they are influenced by Will.



<details open>
<summary><h5>Inoculation</h3></summary>

As an example, [[Inoculation]] is a ramping belief affliction that is caused by [[Chantic Spore|Chantic Spores]], which are carried by largest fungal following in the [[Celia]] kingdom.

<summary><h3>World Information</h3></summary>

This section highlights key historical periods, locations, belief systems, and metaphysical structures shaping Toma and its inhabitants.

<summary><h3>Purpose Taxonomy</h3></summary>

<a href="Purpose Taxonomy.html">Purpose Taxonomy</a> is an ancient classification system that categorizes existence, guiding the understanding of the soul, belief, hierarchies, and power dynamics:

- <a href="Eco.html">Eco</a> (Plane) (Theoretical)  
- <a href="Kingdom.html">Kingdom</a> (Inhabitant)

<summary><h3>Toma</h3></summary>
<img src="wiki_images/Jetti Sound.png"><i>An image of the Jetti Sound, a coastal region of Sancta.</i></img>

Toma is the eco, or plane of existence, for this game. Although, I have heard a few popular scientific theories for an "Ecoss" floating around. You will be starting the game in [[Sancta]], Toma's warmer southern continent.
</details>

<details open>
<summary><h3>Kingdoms</h3></summary>

Each kingdom's eco functions are explored further in their respective notes. Listed below are the kingdoms of creation within [[Toma]]:

- [[Nesa]] (Deity)
- [[Automata]] (Construct)
- [[Bluma]] (Plant and Chromista)
- [[Celia]] (Fungi and claims some bacterial roles)
- [[Decara]] (Archaea and Bacteria)
- [[Ferra]] (Animal)
- [[Huma]] (Humanoid)
- [[Monstra]] (Monster)
- [[Natura]] (Elemental)
- [[Spira]] (Spirit) 
- [[Resonant]] (Multiple Kingdoms)

The **Proto** kingdom, also known as Protista, served as the foundation for the evolution of the Bluma and Decara kingdoms.

Kingdoms are distinguished by their eco/planar/empire function, which may influence character creation and the organization of their belief systems. For example, Ferra and Bluma are considered low-minded creatures, whereas others may be classified as middle-minded or high-minded. This distinction refers to purpose taxonomy and will influence character creation through resonance.

Kingdoms may have subkingdoms, which translate to races and subraces, that pinpoint the same empire function but from a different angle. The term "sub" is used to denote populations within a greater kingdom.

<summary><h3>Resonance</h3></summary>

<img src="wiki_images/Shark Goblin.png"><i>Shark Goblin, a Monstra-Ferra (Goblin-Manger Shark) Resonant, also known as a Varmid.</i></a>

**Resonance** refers to the natural evolution of living creatures existing in two or more kingdoms, integrating their traits and functions. Huma populations have coined many names for resonants based on their kingdom composition and characteristics.

<summary><h3>Historical Understanding</h3></summary>

Toma's timeline is divided into Lines, each concluding with a rotation shift of the <a href="World Gyre.html">World Gyre</a>:

- <a href="Taxotheir Line.html">Taxotheir Line</a>: Studied for its ties to early Huma governance, the remains and artifacts of this time are incredibly sought after by historians. This period of time is only known through this analytical observation, so the narrative is seen through many theories. For example, the roots of Purpose Taxonomy are commonly believed to have survived from this period to the current day, likely originating in a time of scientific and cultural renaissance. Consequently, there are many hypothesis regarding what happened to civilization. For this reason, there is thought to have been a great cataclysm that has since had its signs buried in rewritten history. The prevailing theory in Sol Unita's academic community is that the Taxotheir Line was marked by intense conflict over Hollow Resources. Although popular, there are strong points against this claim, as there are for many topics in the world of Toma.
  
- <a href="Cel Blindbirth Line.html">Cel Blindbirth Line</a>: Nearing the end of this cataclysm, Celia and Primordials quickly began to dominate the overground. Huma populations slowly became the crossfire for a war between these growing kingdoms, forcing Huma societies to reposition underground as the conflicts ramped to heights never observed before. During this time in the subterrain, the Huma population fell steadily, eventually reaching just 4% of the original population before making a recovery in the next line.
  
- <a href="Line from Few.html">Line from Few</a>: Societies slowly began to emerge from their age-long refuge in Endem as Celia's dominance reached its climax come the World Gyre's shift. Societies like the Scepitath (now Sol Unita) and the Branches of Concordia (from Esterik/Esteran Leredith) formed, establishing new balances of faith, trade, and governance. However, it should be known that many other Huma civilizations exist other than the two mentioned here. 

- <a href="Current Line.html">Current Line</a>: We are currently in the 40th year of the Current Line. The most notable event so far has been the expansion of the Airship Pact, a pact made between classes regarding individual demands and expectations of innerplanar travel by airship. This meeting, held in Hypri, hosted powerful speeches to the Chain of Delta, a historically isolated class from the western steppes of Wyldere.

<summary><h3>Hollow Resources</h3></summary>

Hollow Resources are vital materials formed from the transformative breakdown of anim-infused organic matter, leaving behind potent substances that are aligned with the belief sphere of the creature involved. These resources fuel technology, spiritual practices, and sometimes, entire economies.

**Examples**:  
- **Photometal**: Stores and imprints beliefs under preferential light exposure.   
- **Primma**: From Celia's decomposition process. Hardens with moisture.  
- **Aprima**: Purer, light-reflective, form of Primma used in most infrastructure, revered in Sol Unita culture.

These resources underlie societal advancements, often causing power struggles. Throughout the game you will learn of more resources than those shown here.

<summary><h3>Concordia and the Branches of Concordia</h3></summary>

<a href="Concordia">Concordia</a> is a continent governed by the <a href="Branches of Concordia">Branches of Concordia</a>, a government formed around hereditary meritocracy, nationalism, and strict cultural values. Emerging from the ashes of the slow fire that was the Esteran Leredith's decline during the previous Taxotheir and Cel Blindbirth Lines, the Branches forged new roots of governance in the values of unity, cultural heritage, and economic growth at the start of the Line from Few.

In the Current Line, two polarized factions, the <a href="Seos Ofshut">Seos Ofshut</a> and the <a href="Leiflan Ofshut">Leiflan Ofshut</a>, shape the political climate of the Branches. Seos push for foreign trade and expansion, while Leiflan favor isolationism and cultural conservation. Resources like Lichen Pearls and Corlin Trees support both economic and spiritual life, with cities like the capital order of Kaina and the military port city of Be'him holding strategic and historical significance on the continent. The Sedl Continental Army, a mobile governing body and militia, occupies the entire continent except the far, icy reaches to the northeast.

The current state of polarization and political turmoil was a result of the years following the War of Conclusions, with the era being remembered in Concordian culture as the "<a href="Driftwood Nightmare">Driftwood Nightmare</a>". This war was between the Scepitath (now Sol Unita) and the Branches of Concordia, started on the 467th year of the Line from Few and lasted 37 years. You will learn more about the following events soon.
