<summary><h3>Merchant System</h3></summary>

The <a href="Merchant System.md">Merchant System</a> encompasses a grouping of belief-based magic frameworks within the Toman Ecoss, including <a href="Source Surges.md">Source Surges</a>, <a href="Discovery Inspiration.md">Discovery Inspiration</a>, and <a href="Sea Level Spells.md">Sea Level Spells</a>. Its purpose is to let characters harness the power of their beliefs, translating them into tangible abilities that enhance both roleplay and narrative immersion.

**Source Surges**:  
- *Passive Surges*: Natural events triggered by overlapping belief spheres, often influenced by powerful entities or religious Orders. Examples include spontaneous growth of roots from a druid’s grief, or a fighter feeling sudden renewed vigor.
- **Controlled Surges**: Intentional activations of belief by channeling on personal "Claims"—aspects of a character’s faith, virtues, purpose, oaths, and connections.

**Claims**:  
Represent core aspects of a character (Faith, Virtue, Purpose, Oath, Connection). Once all are filled, players can coordinate with the DM to form an avatar of their belief, a manifestation of their ideals given tangible form.

**Restorative Meditation**:  
After using a controlled surge, a character must rest for a week or meditate to restore their abilities. Daily meditative practices speed recovery, each hour of meditation reduces downtime by a day.

**Discovery Inspiration**:  
Replaces traditional DMG Inspiration. By achieving personal milestones, uncovering truths, or fulfilling goals, players earn dice of varying sizes (D4 to D20). Lesser dice (D4–D12) resemble Bardic Inspiration and must be used quickly, while a D20 represents a major milestone and can be saved between sessions.

**Sea Level Spells**:  
A unique, soul-attuned spell or ability—highly personal and reflective of the character’s essence. This is not available at the start of the game.

**Flow State & Stagnant State**:  
- *Flow State*: A meditative state representing perfect alignment of focus.
- *Stagnant State*: A contrasting meditative approach with different narrative implications.

<summary><h3>Anim and Belief Sickness System</h3></summary>

**Anim and Belief Conditions** includes supplemental homebrew sicknesses that affect the player in very different ways as well as a new addition to the character sheet. You will now have a Will statistic which will be a combination of Constitution + Intelligence.

 However Belief Conditions are those that  Overuse or reckless application of Anim-based abilities can lead to conditions that affect a character’s mental and physical well-being. These conditions range from mild fatigue and sensory distortions to more severe ailments that limit a character’s capabilities until properly treated or rested. Discuss specifics with the DM for scenario-based applications.

<summary><h3>Historical Understanding</h3></summary>

Toma’s timeline is divided into Lines, each concluding with a rotation shift of the <a href="World Gyre.md">World Gyre</a>:

- <a href="Taxotheir Line.md">Taxotheir Line</a>: Marked by the formation of early governance, intense conflict over Hollow Resources, and the beginnings of structured Purpose Taxonomy. Rivalries like Esterik vs. Scepitath define this era.
  
- <a href="Cel Blindbirth Line.md">Cel Blindbirth Line</a>: Following the Taxotheir Line’s devastation, Celia and Primordials quickly began to dominate the overground. Huma populations slowly became the crossfire for a war between these kingdoms, forcing Huma societies to reposition underground as the conflicts ramped up. During this time in the subterrain, the Huma population fell steadily, falling to just 4% of the original population before bouncing back in the next line.  This era’s horrors reshaped society, setting the stage for future recoveries.
  
- <a href="Line from Few.md">Line from Few</a>: After emerging from subterranean refuges as Celia’s dominance waned, survivors reclaimed surface regions. Societies like Sol Unita (from Scepitath) and the Branches of Concordia (from Esterik) formed, establishing new balances of faith, trade, and governance.

<summary><h3>Resonance</h3></summary>

**Resonance** refers to beings that exist in two or more kingdoms, integrating their traits and functions. Resonants exists due to  entities that influence ecological and spiritual balance.

<summary><h3>Concordia and the Branches of Concordia</h3></summary>

**Concordia** is a continent governed by the **Branches of Concordia**, a hereditary meritocracy with multiple branches each embodying different societal functions (workforce, administration, intellect, diplomacy, and arts). Emerging after the fall of Esterik during the Taxotheir and Cel Blindbirth Lines, the Branches forged a society valuing unity, cultural heritage, and economic resilience.

Two polarized factions, the **Seos Ofshut** and the **Leiflan Ofshut**, shape Concordia’s political climate. Seos push for foreign trade and expansion, while Leiflan favor isolationism and cultural conservation. Resources like Lichen Pearls and Corlin Trees support both economic and spiritual life, with cities like Kaina and Be’him holding strategic or cultural significance. The Sedl Continental Army exemplifies Concordia’s collective defense and regional pride.

Concordia’s legacy stands as a testament to survival, adaptation, and the intricate interplay between tradition, progress, and the natural world.
