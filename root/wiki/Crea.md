# Crea
_Essence of Time, Time Engine_

<img src="wiki_images/Crea.png"><i></i></img>

**Crea** is the fundamental essence of time and existence within the [[Scape]], acting as the metaphysical core of every soul (or [[Essa]]). It is generated through the synthesis of souls and binds the essence of being to the progression and decay of the universe. Crea manifests in multiple forms, each representing a different aspect of time, memory, and existence.

Crea is the fundamental essence of time within the [[Scape]], acting as the passage through which time flows in the [[Omnis]]. It is generated through the synthesis of souls, binding the essence of existence to the progression and decay of the universe. Crea manifests in multiple forms and components, each representing different aspects of time and existence.

### Components of Crea in the Scape

1. **Print**: The outer shell of a Mollica, storing temporary information bound to a soul. It connects an essence of willpower to otherwise inanimate matter, enabling consciousness. A creature can discern or interact with the state of their Print through [[Meditation]] or another form of [[Soul Perception]]. Mastery of the Print signifies a profound connection between mind and body.

2. **Mixprint**: Contains all temporary information accumulated during a soul's current life, lost upon a [[Mixture Death|Mixture Death]]. Upon [[Imaa#Soul Imaa|Soul Imaa]] or [[Toman Passive Surges (DM Version)#Ascension|Ascension]] ([[Toman Ecoss]]), the Mixprint dissolves into the Innersolvent, preserving information until a [[Mixture Death|Solution Death]].

3. **Innersolvent**: Acts as the repository of permanent data bound to a soul throughout its journey in the Scape, dissolving all prior mixprints into a cohesive whole.

4. **Mollica**: Represents the physical creation of the Scape, known collectively as the Sands of Time. Mollica forms from a Solution Death, serving as unconscious Crea and representing the inert fabric of time itself.

5. **Mollica Dilation**: Refers to the alteration of Crea, impacting time perception. As Mollica is the medium for time's progression, its dilation affects spatial dimensions. Through practices like [[Meditation]], souls can escape fear and confusion, enhancing their temporal experience.


### Crea's Role in the Scape

Crea is the essence that drives the growth and decay of the Omnis, specifically within the Scape. It fuels the cycles of creation and dissolution, allowing the universe to evolve and adapt. Each Question posed by the [[Mk. the Soul Engine]] tests different mindsets, exploring fundamental dualities like linearity versus laterality, and guiding the universe towards understanding and equilibrium.

By synthesizing souls and forming Crea, the universe achieves a dynamic balance, perpetually seeking solutions to its deepest mysteries and challenges.

### Additional Aspects of Crea

- [[Gravity]]
- [[Fate and Free Will]]
- [[Energy]]







“The state of ‘being alive’ is difficult to characterize because ‘life’ is currently defined using superficial features or long-term processes, rather than a single physical property unique to living things. For instance, biological molecules exhibit a vast range of structures and attributes, and a shared property is elusive. However, current knowledge suggests that key biomolecules governing a range of fundamental processes within cells do share one specific characteristic: all respond to energy absorption and dissipation by changing conformation and thus physical shape along one plane. Cyclic, repeated uniplanar shape changes induce unidirectional motion (linear or rotational movement) in molecules and the processes they govern, which is the basis of mechanistic activity and work within cells. In contrast, molecules in non-living systems do not change conformation in a way that performs work. The premise of energy conversion into directed motion suggests that life is a process whereby self-governing networks of molecular ‘heat engines’ create structure, whereas non-living structures are created and maintained by non-heat engine processes. A definition of life based on autonomous heat engine networks does not depend on any specific type of molecule or chemical process, and is potentially applicable to chemical environments different from those on Earth.”

## Components of Crea

1. **Print:** The outer shell of a soul, storing temporary information and connecting willpower to matter. Mastery of the Print signifies a deep mind-body connection.
2. **Mixprint:** Contains all temporary information from a soul's current life, lost upon [[Mixture Death]]. Dissolves into the Innersolvent upon ascension or soul transformation.
3. **Innersolvent:** The repository of permanent data, binding all prior Mixprints into a cohesive whole throughout a soul's journey.
4. **Mollica:** The physical creation of the Scape, known as the Sands of Time. Forms from a Solution Death, representing unconscious Crea and the inert fabric of time.
5. **Mollica Dilation:** The alteration of Crea, affecting time perception and spatial experience. Through meditation or soul practices, one can influence their experience of time.

## Crea's Role in the Scape

Crea drives the cycles of growth and decay in the universe, fueling the evolution of souls and the cosmos. It is the engine behind the passage of time, the storage of memory, and the realization of purpose. Through the synthesis of souls and the formation of Crea, the universe perpetually seeks balance and understanding.
