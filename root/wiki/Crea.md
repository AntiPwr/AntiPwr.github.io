# Crea
_Essence of Time, Time Engine_

<img src="wiki_images/Crea.png"><i></i></img>

**Crea** is the fundamental essence of time and existence within the [[Scape]], acting as the metaphysical core of every soul (or [[Essa]]). It is generated through the synthesis of souls and binds the essence of being to the progression and decay of the universe. Crea manifests in multiple forms, each representing a different aspect of time, memory, and existence.

## Components of Crea

1. **Print:** The outer shell of a soul, storing temporary information and connecting willpower to matter. Mastery of the Print signifies a deep mind-body connection.
2. **Mixprint:** Contains all temporary information from a soul's current life, lost upon [[Mixture Death]]. Dissolves into the Innersolvent upon ascension or soul transformation.
3. **Innersolvent:** The repository of permanent data, binding all prior Mixprints into a cohesive whole throughout a soul's journey.
4. **Mollica:** The physical creation of the Scape, known as the Sands of Time. Forms from a Solution Death, representing unconscious Crea and the inert fabric of time.
5. **Mollica Dilation:** The alteration of Crea, affecting time perception and spatial experience. Through meditation or soul practices, one can influence their experience of time.

## Crea's Role in the Scape

Crea drives the cycles of growth and decay in the universe, fueling the evolution of souls and the cosmos. It is the engine behind the passage of time, the storage of memory, and the realization of purpose. Through the synthesis of souls and the formation of Crea, the universe perpetually seeks balance and understanding.
