**Class**: **Branches of Concordia**

The **Branches of Concordia** is a **[[Class]]** located on the continent of **[[Concordia]]**. This governance structure, known as a Hereditary Meritocracy, prioritizes merit and abilities within familial branches, each representing a different facet of Concordian society. Together, these branches ensure comprehensive management and the stability of the region.

#### Historical Origins

The Branches of Concordia trace their origins to the fall of the **[[Esterik]]** during the **[[Taxotheir Line|Taxotheir Line]]** and the **[[Cel Blindbirth Line|Cel Blindbirth Line]]**. The remnants of Esterik, left in subterranean ruins, gave rise to two polarized factions: the **[[Seos Ofshut]]** and the **[[Leiflan Ofshut]]**. These factions, initially cooperating under mutual policies established during the **[[Line from Few|Line from Few]]**, were foundational in the formation of the Branches of Concordia from Esterik's ashes.

#### Lahsom Leadership

The leadership of the Branches of Concordia is embodied by the **Lahsom**, an individual elected biennially from any branch based on demonstrated leadership skills. The Lahsom is responsible for promoting unity, managing cultural activities, and overseeing the broader administration of Concordia, ensuring the continued prosperity and stability of the region.

    The Root Branch focuses on infrastructure and agriculture, forming the foundation of Concordian society by ensuring its sustainability through well-managed representation of workers' interests.

### Economic and Cultural Significance

Concordia's economy is heavily reliant on several key resources, including lumber, fish, stone, **[[Lichen Pearl]]s**, **[[Photometal]]**, and the **[[Corlin Tree]]**. Among these, Lichen Pearls are particularly valuable, with prices ranging from 300 to 600 gold depending on size. These pearls are crucial for creating healing potions, requiring about four pearls for a small potion.

The Corlin Tree is another vital resource, valued not only for its physical properties but also for its symbolic significance, representing unity and connection within Concordian society. The tree's dual-root system and unique transportation abilities make it a cornerstone of Concordian infrastructure and culture.

### The Sedl Continental Army

The **Sedl Continental Army** is the overarching military force shared by the various cities under the Branches of Concordia. This military is guided by multiple military positions from different cities, with the composition of the army being spread by the guidance of multiple local governments. These local governments, while following the overarching rules of the Branches, are granted slight variations in order to promote a unified goal for the whole. This includes military training and diplomacy, ensuring that all regions contribute to the defense and stability of Concordia.

The Sedl Continental Army is renowned for its strategic coordination and the unique war perspectives incorporated by each city, particularly **[[Be'him]]**, a city that views war as an art form. This shared military force is a symbol of Concordian unity, reflecting the region's commitment to collective security and the protection of its homeland.

### Political Dynamics

The **Seos Ofshut** seeks to expand Concordia's influence by opening trade routes to the **[[Swirling Sea]]** and engaging in foreign politics. In contrast, the **Leiflan Ofshut** remains conservative, adhering to the policies established during the formation of the Branches of Concordia. This ideological divide continues to shape the political landscape of Concordia, with each faction striving for control over the region’s future direction.

### Key Cities and Their Roles

- [[Be'him]]: A southwestern coastal port city known for its military orientation, Be'him is deeply involved in the Sedl Continental Army and is considered a Leiflan-oriented city. The city's unique approach to warfare, treating it as an art form, reflects its pride in the nation and its dedication to defending Concordia. Be'him is a city that shares love and acceptance with any creature home to Concordia, utilizing innovative practices to protect the region from external threats.
    
- [[Lethrik]]: The first city of the Branches of Concordia and the previous capital, Lethrik is known for its cultural pride and resource gathering, including mining, pearl diving, and lumber. The city's history is marked by its Seos policies, which nearly led to the extinction of the Corlin Tree. Currently, Lethrik leans towards the Leiflan faction by about 10 percent (60/40 split), reflecting its ongoing struggle between tradition and progress.
    
- [[Kaina]]: The current capital of the Branches of Concordia, Kaina is situated in a mountain and hill valley, accessible only from the valley opening in the south. The city is at a very high altitude, with the peaks controlled by the **Sedl Guard**s, who keep detailed records of every creature passing through. Kaina is the heart of Concordian governance, where the Lahsom resides and where the policies that guide the entire region are formulated and enforced.
    

### Cultural Traditions

Pearl Diving for **[[Lichen Pearls]]** in the **[[Sea of Absence]]** is a revered cultural tradition that dates back to the era of **[[Esterik]]**. The ancient Esterik people developed the meditative practices essential for retrieving these precious pearls from the ocean's deepest trenches. This knowledge was preserved and passed down through generations of Concordians, who continue to honor this tradition. Pearl Divers are highly esteemed within Concordia for their skills and dedication, and the practice remains a symbol of the region's deep connection to its past and its natural resources.

### Conclusion

The Branches of Concordia represent a unique blend of tradition, innovation, and collective governance. Through their shared military, the Sedl Continental Army, and their emphasis on meritocracy within familial branches, Concordians have created a society that values unity, cultural heritage, and the protection of their homeland. As they continue to navigate the challenges of the modern world, the Branches of Concordia remain committed to their principles, ensuring that their region thrives both economically and culturally.
