## Rank and Command
Aj'iru is the highest ranking general in the Chain of Delta, presiding over the third [[Omep region]] of Kleznit and the operations of the Kleznit Advance.

## Dual Forms and Spirituality
Shifts between a lanky, agile hunter and a raging fighter using two different preferred drugs. The two different drugs bring him into a spiritual headspace where he sees the spirit of the opposing drug. The spirit contrasts the spiritual space that the drug puts Aj'iru in, making the spirit easy to spot. When switching into one form, the other form watches over as a spirit. It is like the devil and angel on the shoulder but instead he tag teams either the devil or the angel into reality while the other watches and offers guidance. The spirit form is always tribal.

## Ancestral Spirits and Cultural Heritage
Jarami and Varo are both ancestors of Delta, brought over from distant lands and integrated into society. These ancestors originated from a warmer region, resulting in a spiritual appearance that blends intricate, symbolic body art and ceremonial adornments with the snowy, rugged aesthetic of Wyldere. The cultural heritage is expressed through a fusion of ancestral reverence and the harsh environment, creating a unique tradition of spiritual guidance and resilience.

## Relationship with Faith and the Chain
Aj'iru believes in his own creator, but reveres Hidraal and Indhost. He primarily uses Klesn as a tool for the expansion of the Chain's operation in Wyldere. Although Aj'iru does not follow the religious narrative, he acts accordingly, as he heavily agrees with the political philosophy of the Chain that comes with Klesn. His relationship with faith is pragmatic, blending personal belief with the ambitions of the Chain.

## Combat Style and Public Persona
Aj'iru's enraged form is massive, with thick forearms and slightly bulging eyes, inspired by legendary warriors and mythic champions. His agile form is lanky and strategic, focused and capable socially. He is known for his chain tattoos and his ability to fight using a blowgun (pucuna) or a bow, while his other form excels in mixed martial arts. Aj'iru was often the fight promoter and the main card of the fight, gaining connections and influence through public displays of combat.

He is known for his chain tattoos and his ability to fight using a blowgun (pucuna) or a bow, while his other form excels in mixed martial arts. During his earlier years in Delta, prior to political power, Aj'iru was known as both a street fight promoter and desired main card of his hosted fights, gaining connections and influence through his public displays of combat.

## Relationship with Fuscia Lustin and Other Leaders
Aj'iru and Fuscia have a close relationship, as Aj'iru was given his position by Fuscia, whereas other leaders ruled since the last Medan. Fuscia knows Aj'iru is not entirely faithful to Klesn and sees it as beneficial. Aj'iru is closest with Fuscia, although Fuscia is often consumed by Kee's desires. Aj'iru was appointed into his position with the sole consent of the Medan, and from the public perspective, is in the same bureaucratic position as other high officials, though in reality, he is closest with Fuscia.

## Legacy and Symbolism
Aj'iru's spirit body is mythicized and is said to be able to communicate with other spirits. His spirit is given a symbolic depiction in Deltan culture, and his powerful belief pool attracts ancestor spirits which act as his two guiding spirits throughout his life. His legacy is marked by resilience, adaptability, and a unique blend of spiritual and martial traditions.

## Jarami

<img src="wiki_images/Jarami 1.png"></img>

Jarami is the enraged spirit form of Aj'iru—a massive, thickly muscled troll with slightly bulging eyes and prominent tusks. His body is built for raw power, inspired by legendary warriors and mythic champions. The skin is rough and marked by tribal scars, frostbite patterns, and ritualistic tattoos that glow faintly in the cold. His hair is wild, often styled into a mohawk with frost-tipped ends, and his overall look blends frostpunk brutality with tribal mystique.

Jarami's presence is intimidating: he moves with heavy, deliberate steps, and his posture is always ready for combat. The chains and markings on his body are more pronounced, symbolizing his connection to ancestral rage and the harsh environment of Wyldere. In battle, Jarami channels the spirit of the berserker, using overwhelming strength and primal aggression to dominate his foes. His attire is minimal, suited for a warm climate but made from dark, heavy materials that evoke both wealth and survival.

## Varo

<img src="wiki_images/Varo 1.png"></img>

Varo is a towering, hypermasculine female spirit, standing at 7'7" (7'1" when naturally hunched). Her physique is defined by elongated, flexible muscles and a natural arch to her posture, giving her a lanky yet powerfully muscular build. Varo's body is built for agility and endurance, allowing her to move with a fluid grace that borders on the acrobatic. She is often seen in poses that highlight her flexibility, such as sitting cross-legged or crouched low to the ground, ready to spring into action. Her movements are unencumbered by armor, giving her an almost spectral presence in combat.

The skin of Varo is a muted, dark greyish-purple, often dulled further by layers of grime, dust, and ritual smudging. This lived-in appearance speaks to years spent surviving in harsh, unforgiving environments. Faded tattoos and ceremonial markings run along her arms, chest, and back, blending ancestral symbols with motifs of resilience and adaptation. Her complexion carries a subtle metallic sheen, and her face is adorned with small metal stud earrings, hinting at both personal history and tribal identity.

Varo’s eyes are a striking light blue, appearing to burn with an inner flame that reflects her intense focus and spiritual connection. Her gaze alternates between a deadpan stare and a sly, knowing smile, often accompanied by a sharp wit and psychological banter. These expressions serve both to unsettle opponents and to mask her own vulnerabilities, revealing a complex personality that is equal parts charismatic and unpredictable.

The tusks of Varo droop slightly, showing signs of wear and age. They may be decorated with rings, carvings, or embedded charms, each telling a story of past battles and personal achievements. Occasionally, the tusks display asymmetry, further emphasizing her unique character and the scars of her journey.

Varo’s attire is minimal, designed for both comfort in warm climates and survival in colder ones. Dark metals and leathers are fashioned into decorative chains and accents that drape across her body, highlighting key points such as the waist and head. Gold highlights add a touch of wealth and status, while the overall design remains rooted in tribal tradition and personal flair. Essential coverage is limited, with most clothing serving as ornamentation rather than protection.

Hidden within Varo’s armor are discreet mechanisms for delivering substances—compartments in chains, darts, or weapon tips that allow for strategic use of drugs in battle. These features are subtle, their presence revealed only in the way Varo moves and fights, suggesting a mastery of both physical and chemical warfare.

Varo is armed with a blowgun and a spear, sometimes combining the two into a single weapon capable of firing poison-tipped darts and serving as a melee implement. The poisons used are visible on the weapon tips, occasionally glowing or leaving a colored residue, adding an element of psychological intimidation to her arsenal.

The overall aesthetic of Varo blends tribal heritage with industrial motifs, symbolizing a history of enslavement, resilience, and spiritual lineage. Chains, metals, and tattoos evoke both ancestral reverence and the harsh realities of survival. In her spirit form, these features may become more ethereal—chains appearing to float, tattoos glowing faintly, and a mist enveloping her body, marking the boundary between the physical and the spiritual.

## Notable Exploits and Influence
Aj'iru used to fight for show in the streets of Almalek, wrangling creatures and putting on displays for the people while training his own combat skills. He gained many connections and led influential gatherings, eventually being offered a position in the military by Fuscia Lustin. Aj'iru's exploits and influence have shaped the new age of soldiers and the operations of the Chain in Wyldere.

Acutane (Jarami) and Yjokif (Varo) are the two drugs that have formed into spirit personalities for Aj'iru. His powerful belief pool attracts ancestor spirits which act as his two guiding spirits throughout his life.

Aj'iru used to fight for show in the streets of Almalek. He would wrangle the creatures all by himself and put on a show for the people whilst training his combat. He would do this process on his own. He got a lot of connections from this process and would lead hangouts with people who would benefit him. Aj'iru has lost many friends along the way, but has also gained many new friends, including most importantly Fuscia Lustin as a child. Fuscia watched Aj'iru set up fights all through his youth and Fuscia learned from this. When Fuscia rose to power, he offered Aj'iru a position in the military guiding a new age of soldiers.

Aj'iru was often the fight promoter and the main card of the fight. Aj'iru was appointed into his position with the sole consent of the Medan. Aj'iru from the public perspective is in the same hated bureaucratic position as Selyman Oth and Isaheim Maddows. Although, in reality, Aj'iru is closest with Fuscia. Fuscia is closest with Kee and second closest to Aj'iru.
