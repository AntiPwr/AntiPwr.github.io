## Introduction to Campaign 1: Whisper of the Well

You will be starting the game in Concordia, for a brief flashback to a play at the [[Ember Petal Foundation]], a performing arts theater in the Concordian capital [[Order]] of [[Kaina]]. The magnificence and natural beauty of the theater draws in Concordian politicians, elites, renowned artists, and brilliant scholars to experience. The play incorporates the use of [[Ester Slate|Ester Slates]], and thus runs at an expensive ticket price of 1,500 Leives (Concordian currency, pronounced as "leaves").



To escape from the political tension, he will offer you a chance to leave Kaina and visit Scender. He even gives you the chance to leave a week earlier. 

## War of Conclusions, the Ofshuts, and the Driftwood Nightmare

The **War of Conclusions** was a critical conflict fought at the end of the [[7 Line from Few|Line from Few]], primarily between **Scender Unita** (now [[Sol Unita]]) and the **[[Branches of Concordia]]**, though it also deeply affected the Agresta region as well. Spanning three major battles—sometimes referred to as “Matches” when fought in uncontrolled territory (e.g., the [[Battle of Agresta]], [[Battle of Land, Sea, and Storm]])—the war arose from clashing ideologies on how Toma should be utilized or preserved. The **Presceptist** forces claimed a god-given right to shape Toma, pursuing ascension, while the **Esterik** faction treasured Toma’s natural beauty above all. This philosophical rift intensified after a meeting between Judh and Laje Etlin, who found no middle ground.

During the war, the **Swirling Sea** initially flowed counterclockwise, granting Scender Unita a strategic naval edge. At the conclusion of hostilities, **Scender Unita** extended reconstruction assistance to the Branches of Concordia under the condition that Concordia not impede their future goals in Agresta Jungle. Some Concordians resented what they perceived as forced dependency, leading to a deep political split:

- **Seos Ofshut**: Advocates cooperation with Sol Unita and acceptance of Concordia’s war-time responsibility.  
- **Leiflan Ofshut**: Emphasizes Concordian self-reliance and preservation of traditions, wary of foreign entanglements.  

Roughly fourteen years later, the **Swirling Sea** abruptly reversed to a clockwise flow—an event that baffled Concordians, who lacked historical records of such phenomena. Many refer to the resulting turmoil as the **Driftwood Nightmare**, a grim period where they felt at the mercy of both foreign powers and the seemingly capricious plane itself.

### the Gyre Shift

Soon after the war’s conclusion, Toma experienced a massive **Gyre Shift**: mountain ranges slipped, vast caverns collapsed, and tectonic plates ripped open with shocking force. Ancient whispers hint this cataclysm may have happened before during the [[Cel Blindbirth Line]], but the scale felt unprecedented to modern Huma. In Concordia, the shift compounded the existing exhaustion from war and a newly reversed sea current, adding to the growing sense that all was lost.

### Seos and Leiflan Response

- **Seos Ofshut**: Urges continued ties with Sol Unita, harnessing foreign collaboration to remain relevant on the global stage.  
- **Leiflan Ofshut**: Doubles down on cultural identity and resource guardianship, wary of overdependence on outsiders.  

### Jola Acker’s Perspective

Politics has always been in the way of your parents. Your father, an idealist, thinks that things do not have to be the way they are so long as you are reminded of what got you there. Change is inevitable, but it doesn't mean that you have to lose your roots. This is where his deep love for the culture of Concordia sprouts, as well as his solid stance against the Seos. 

### Lichen Pearls and Pearl Diving

Concordia’s economy relies heavily on **Lichen Pearls**, vital for crafting powerful healing elixirs. This pearl-diving tradition, passed down through families, serves as both a cultural cornerstone and a political bargaining chip. While Seos Ofshut sees potential profit and alliances, Leiflan Ofshut demands stringent regulation on pearl exports to preserve Concordia’s sanctity.

#### Kalina Acker’s Disappearance

**It has been five years since your mother's death**  

Though recorded as deceased, the circumstances around Kalina Acker’s final dive remain unresolved. The echoes of that tragedy still color your personal journey, embodying the broader tension within Concordian society as it recovers from war, faces the unpredictable sea, and grapples with its own political divide.
