## Starting Location

You will be starting the game in Concordia, for a brief flashback to a play at the [[Ember Petal Foundation]], a performing arts theater in the Concordian capital [[Order]] of [[Kaina]]. The magnificence and natural beauty of the theater draws in Concordian politicians, elites, renowned artists, and brilliant scholars to experience. The play incorporates the use of [[Ester Slate|Ester Slates]], and thus runs at an expensive ticket price of 1,500 Leives (Concordian currency).
