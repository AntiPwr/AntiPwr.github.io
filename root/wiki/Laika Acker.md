## Starting Location

You will be starting the game in Concordia, for a brief flashback to a play at the [[Ember Petal Foundation]], a performing arts theater in the Concordian capital [[Order]] of [[Kaina]]. The magnificence and natural beauty of the theater draws in Concordian politicians, elites, renowned artists, and brilliant scholars to experience. The play incorporates the use of [[Ester Slate|Ester Slates]], and thus runs at an expensive ticket price of 1,500 Leives (Concordian currency, pronounced as "leaves" still.).

## War of Conclusions and the Driftwood Nightmare
{it is important to note in this section that the shift of the world gyre felt like kick to the ground that also ignited the Driftwood Nightmare, as it felt as if even god was against them. It would have been benificial if the Branches of Concordia could have benefited from the Swirling Sea pushing towards Agresta and Scender. Instead, the entire war, the Branches of Concordia were on the backfoot due to the water and winds being against them. Include how much aid the Scepitath gave to the Branches of Concordia following the war. Truly, the Scepitath tried and did a good job at reconstruction. When the Scepitath reformed under Sol Unita and Asceptim, their growth skyrocketed leaving the Branches of Concordia in the background.}

### the Gyre Shift

Shortly after the bloodiest battle between the Branches of Concordia and the Scepitath (now Sol Unita), the entire plane of Toma experienced a calamitous event, the Gyre Shift. Entire continents shoved by tectonic plates, caverns of Endem collapsed without little warning, mountains ranges moved hundreds of miles. This is thought to have occured before in the history of your people during the end of the [[Cel Blindbirth Line]]. This story will be touched upon during the play at the start of the game. 


### Seos and Leiflan Response

{Explain the Seos and their opinion on expanding relationships with Sol Unita and the ideology shift to Adescep. Explain Leiflan focus on preserving natural resources (if not preserve, put at a high price so that it is an advantageous and uneven trade), as it is the only thing that keeps Sol Unita from destroying them. They believe this is the best way to promote Concordian society and rid the domestic conflict. }
