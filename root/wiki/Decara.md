**Decara** is an ancient kingdom of destruction within the [[Toman Ecoss]], composed of both archaea and bacteria. Throughout most of Toma, the Decara Kingdom is thought to be extinct or no longer exist, but in small, hidden pockets of the eco, the Decara are known to persist—though not always under that name or in their original form (resonance). The story of the Decara has been loosely reconstructed through archaeological efforts, spearheaded by Sol Unita and their alliances. Much of what is known comes from the study of ruins and artifacts, as well as the analysis of Social Taxonomy (Taxotheir Line), the taxonomic system in use when the Decara were believed to roam Toma.

The Decara have played a pivotal role in shaping the history and ecology of the plane, existing since the creation of [[Toma]]. Their influence is deeply woven into the fabric of Toma, manifesting through cycles of destruction, adaptation, and the relentless pursuit of ascension.

<!--## Main Section

The origin of **Decara** traces back to the [[Two Virus Mythos]], a primordial struggle between [[Gorisain]] and [[Desthema]] that shaped the nature of bacteria and decay within Toma. The Decara kingdom is marked by its adaptability and the instinctual drive for destruction, often targeting the foundations of life and creation. Their worship of Gorisain, the Protomartyr and Nesa of the Decara, is central to their culture and rituals.

Decaran creatures are identifiable by the shade of their blood, which changes with age—from fleshy pink in newborns to metallicized gray in ancient creatures. The kingdom is further divided into subkingdoms, each with distinct roles, such as [[Bluthrut]], [[Darit]], [[Defiled]], [[Mimidry]], [[Proto]], and [[Veirgo]].

A defining trait of the Decara is their ritualistic feasting, where the consumption of living creatures and corpses is both a spiritual and practical act. These feasts, held twice daily, are believed to influence the growth and adaptation of Decaran society. The Decara have also constructed intricate tunnel systems, serving as places of worship and connection to Gorisain’s consciousness in the [[Soul Fields]].

The Decara’s relentless pursuit of ascension is driven by the prophecy of The Carrion, which foretells the rise of an individual who will lead Gorisain into the next dimension. Their destructive nature is not merely an empire function but an ideology under Gorisain’s guidance, shaping their actions and aspirations across the Toman Ecoss.
