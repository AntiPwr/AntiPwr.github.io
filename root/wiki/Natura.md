# Natura
_Elemental Kingdom, Lifeless Kingdom, Kingdom of Matter

Natura are the elementals—the conscious, soul-like beings of the Elemental Kingdom. Unlike living creatures, they are not animated by biology but by convergence: the fusion of anima, belief, and environmental trauma. Their name omits the “l” from _natural_, symbolizing the absence of conventional life. Instead, Natura are shaped by intention, ritual, and the will to become something greater. Each is a product of the world’s raw forces, yet they display wisdom, stoicism, and a drive to evolve.

## The Allmother and Her Children

All Natura trace their origin to [[Almauder]], the Allmother—an ineffable soul dormant beneath all elements. Her essence is the womb of convergence, and from her flow the [[Children]], pure manifestations of elemental archetypes. These Children are not beings, but primordial essences. All Natura strive to become them—not metaphorically, but truly. This is the core drive of their kingdom: to evolve into the next All, replacing the old one through upheaval and mastery of belief and form. This is not inheritance, but war through ritual and transformation.

## The Children of Almauder

Each Child represents an elemental ideal. Natura worship a pantheon of various perspectives of perfection. However, local regions often develop folk cults around a single Child, bonding themselves to its catastrophe and creative potential. No two lands share the same Child. Temples to the Children are rare, rising only through ritual disaster—a quake for [[Alroc]], a glacier for [[Alsno]].

### Known Children
- **[[Allflame]]** – the perfect fire, ever-consuming and ever-renewing.

> _Many Children are unnamed, hidden, or regional—discovered through disastrous revelation._

## Subnatura: The Elemental Species

Each **Subnatura** is a specific type of elemental being, loyal (or aspiring) to a single Child. Where Natura is a kingdom, Subnatura is a species. A [[Wind Natura]] differs wholly from a [[Fire Natura]], not only in form, but in drive, ritual, and afterlife. Each Subnatura is tied to a Child and strives to become the next All by enacting greater change than their predecessor. They spawn disasters not out of cruelty, but ambition.

### Known Subnatura
- [[Fire Natura]] (Allflame)
- [[Snow Natura]] 
- [[Ice Natura]] 
- [[Rock Natura]] 
- [[Shadow Natura]] 
- [[Wind Natura]] 
- [[Gyre Natura]] 
- [[Light Natura]] 
- [[Salt Natura]]

## Convergence Reputation

A creature’s **Reputation** with a Subnatura lineage is determined by the [[Will]] they surrender to the Child’s ideal. **Will (WIL)** represents a creature’s internal compass: their drive, ideals, and spiritual resilience. In the world of the Natura, Will is currency, sacrifice, and identity.

**Maximum WIL = CON + STR + DEX + WIS + INT + CHA + PB**

### Will-Based Reputation Ranks

- **Ally** (≥ 10% WIL): Elemental branding (Will-transfer).
- **Acolyte** (≥ 25% WIL): Subnatura no longer hostile. Access to the Claim (Merchant System).
- **Adept** (≥ 50% WIL): Gain a minor elemental familiar or resistance to the damage type. While this elemental is summoned, you may alter your attack's damage to the chosen element once. When the elemental damages a creature, this feature is reset.
- **Archon** (≥ 75% WIL): Access to convergence tokens which can summon natural catastrophes through rites.
- **Allfather** (≥ 100% WIL): Immunity to the element type. You are considered a candidate to become the new All.

> **Note:** Reclaiming your Will is possible, but difficult. It may require defeating the one who marked you or undergoing a ritual of [[Severance|self-severance]].

## Natural Convergence: Reproduction and Disaster

Subnatura reproduce through convergence: anima + belief + disaster = birth. Ceremonial convergence is public and planned. Emotional convergence is private, spontaneous, and spiritually potent—often resulting in rare and mythic offspring. Some regions fear emotional convergence, calling it _the soulquake_.

Natura reproduce through ceremonial infusions of potent anima into the elements, called natural convergence. This results in natural disasters, centered around the theme of the ceremonial infusion. For example, rock Natura would likely revolve their ceremonies around earthquakes, pumping anima into the earth in order to spawn more rock elementals during the disaster. These events are called mass spawns or spawn disasters and they are always caused by Natura. Additionally, the anima that is placed by Natura into their desired medium is affected by their beliefs, sometimes altering their spawn and the type of disaster to occur, most often to the Natura’s advantage. Natura can also reproduce through individual means, but this requires a large output of potent anima through an emotional release. Similarly to the ceremonial process, this variation of emotional convergence process also results in beliefs entering the young elemental, however in this case it is much more potent. Through process of emotional release comes from the creation of Natura, as told in the Goda Mythos.

## Worship and Regional Practice

Natura worship the Allmother, but some also worship her Children—Allflame, Alsno, Alroc, Alice, and others. Worshippers of a Child are unique to a single region; no two places revere the same Child. Worship is expressed through ritual, disaster, and the pursuit of elemental perfection, not through temples or icons.

## Philosophy and the Nature of Change

Natura are defined by their relationship to the other kingdoms, as the environment itself is without moral. Natural disasters are not inherently influenced by Natura ideology; rather, their beliefs are shaped in response to the state of their All and the world. Each All is a single soul, and to become an All, a Natura must replace the old one’s soul through a movement that brings about greater change. The creature who is capable of causing the most change can become the next All, making the kingdom a living scoreboard of transformation and ambition.

## Shrines Born from Disaster: Sacred Sites of the Children

In the world of the Natura, shrines and places of worship are not constructed but revealed. When a Child wishes to be known, the world itself may reshaped by disaster, and from the chaos, a sacred site emerges. These events are rare, awe-inspiring, and often terrifying, for they are the direct result of the Allmother’s will or the ambition of a Child.

A tsunami may sweep across a coastline, and as the waters recede, an underwater palace of worship is revealed—columns of coral and salt-encrusted stone, illuminated by shafts of sunlight that pierce the waves, a sanctum only accessible to those who can brave the depths. In the aftermath of a great earthquake, the ground may split open to reveal a perfect entrance: a spiral stair of obsidian leading down to a chamber lined with glowing veins of crystal, the air thick with the scent of ozone and ancient earth. Sometimes, a glacier will calve, and within the newly exposed ice, a cathedral of blue and silver is found, its walls etched with runes of frost and memory, echoing with the voices of the lost.

These sites are not merely religious—they become centers of power, pilgrimage, and even political intrigue. A forest fire might burn so hot that it hollows out a grove, leaving behind a ring of blackened trees that encircle a single, untouched sapling: a living altar to Allflame. A sandstorm may scour the desert, and when the winds die, a labyrinth of glass tunnels is found beneath the dunes, shimmering with the heat of the sun and the promise of hidden knowledge.

To the Natura, these shrines are living proof of the Children’s presence and favor. They are places where the boundary between the elemental and the mortal is thinnest, where rituals are performed, alliances are forged, and destinies are rewritten. Each disaster-born site is unique, shaped by the element and the beliefs of those who witness its birth—a testament to the ever-changing, ever-ambitious soul of the Elemental Kingdom.

**Bin:** [[Scape]]  
**Basin:** [[Sacrus]]  
**Eco:** [[Toma]] of [[Toman Ecoss]]  
**Kingdom:** [[Natura]]

The [[Natura]] are elementals—conscious beings born of natural forces, yet without what Huma call “life.” Their name omits the “l” from _natural_, symbolizing this very absence. They are not animated by biology but by convergence: the infusion of [[anima]], [[belief]], and environmental trauma. Yet they appear soulful, stoic, and wise, as if sculpted by intention. Their kind are separated into **Subnatura**, such as [[Fire Natura]], [[Gyre Natura]], or [[Shadow Natura]].

## The Allmother and Her Children

All Natura trace their origin to **Almauder**, or the Allmother—an ineffable soul who lies dormant beneath all elements. Her essence is the womb of convergence, and from her flow the **Children**, pure manifestations of elemental archetypes. These children are not beings, but **primordial essences**, perfect and unreachable. All Natura strive to _become_ them—not metaphorically, but truly. It is the core drive of their kingdom: to evolve into the **next All**, replacing the old one through upheaval and mastery of belief and form.

This is not inheritance. It is war through ritual and tectonic transformation.

## The Children of Almauder

Each Child represents an **elemental ideal**. Natura do not worship a pantheon—they strive toward perfection. However, **local regions** often develop _folk cults_ around a single Child, bonding themselves to its catastrophe and creative potential. No two lands share the same Child.

Temples to the Children are rare. They do not rise by hand but **through ritual disaster**—a quake that opens a shrine to [[Alroc]], a glacier splitting to reveal a hall for [[Alsno]].

### Known Children

- **[[Allflame]]** – the perfect fire, ever-consuming and ever-renewing.
    
- **[[Alsno]]** – the soul of snow, still and silent.
    
- **[[Alice]]** – the purest form of cold and clarity, ice without melt.
    
- **[[Alroc]]** – the world’s bones, deep stone forged in pressure.
    
- **[[Allume]]** – light not of sun but of divine recognition.
    
- **[[Alocht]]** – shadow that resists creation, the depth behind presence.
    
- **[[Alveil]]** – the unseen wind that shapes sky and sail.
    
- **[[Algyre]]** – the spiral, the unseen motion within stillness.
    
- **[[Algaea]]** – living land, fertile and slow-moving.
    
- **[[Albrine]]** – salt and corrosion, the entropy of water.

## Subnatura

Each **Subnatura** is a specific type of elemental being, loyal (or aspiring) to a single Child. Where Natura is a kingdom, Subnatura is a species. A [[Wind Natura]] differs wholly from a [[Fire Natura]], not only in form, but in **drive, ritual, and afterlife**.

Known Subnatura include:

- [[Fire Natura]] (Allflame)
    
- [[Snow Natura]] (Alsno)
    
- [[Ice Natura]] (Alice)
    
- [[Stone Natura]] (Alroc)
    
- [[Shadow Natura]] (Alocht)
    
- [[Wind Natura]] (Alveil)
    
- [[Gyre Natura]] (Algyre)
    
- [[Light Natura]] (Allume)
    
- [[Salt Natura]] (Albrine)
    
- [[Forest Natura]] (Algaea)
    
- [[Moss Natura]]
    
- [[Mist Natura]]
    
- [[Ash Natura]]
    
- [[Iron Natura]]
    
- [[Storm Natura]]
    
- [[Crystal Natura]]
    
- [[Mud Natura]]
    
- [[Glass Natura]]
    
- [[Steam Natura]]
    
- [[Dust Natura]]
    

Each Subnatura is tied to a **Child**, and strives to become the **next All** by enacting greater change than their predecessor. They spawn disasters not out of cruelty, but ambition.

## The Will System and Reputation

A creature’s **Reputation** with a Subnatura lineage is determined by the [[Will]] they surrender to the Child’s ideal.

**Will (WIL)** represents a creature’s internal compass: their drive, ideals, and spiritual resilience. In the world of the Natura, Will is **currency**, **sacrifice**, and **identity**.

**Maximum WIL = CON + STR + DEX + WIS + INT + CHA + PB**

### Will-Based Reputation Ranks

Reputation with a Subnatura lineage is **measured by how much of your Will belongs to their ideal**. For example, making a pact with a Fire Natura and completing its rites brands you with **Will to the Allflame**.

Each rank grants mechanical and narrative benefits in 5e:

| Rank          | Will Invested | Effects                                                                                                               |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ally**      | ≥ 1 WIL       | Natura no longer hostile. Elemental branding. Minor reactions from Subnatura.                                         |
| **Acolyte**   | ≥ 3 WIL       | Advantage on INT checks related to that element. Recognition in regional temples.                                     |
| **Adept**     | ≥ 6 WIL       | Resistance to the elemental damage type. You gain one minor elemental feature.                                        |
| **Archon**    | ≥ 10 WIL      | Access to the **Merchant System**—trade anima, convergence tokens, or catastrophe rites.                              |
| **Allfather** | ≥ 14 WIL      | Immunity to the element type. Ability to sponsor a convergence. You are considered a candidate to become the new All. |

>  **Note:** Reclaiming your Will is possible, but difficult. It may require defeating the one who marked you or undergoing a ritual of self-severance.

## Natural Convergence (Expanded)

See [[Natural Convergence]] for more.

Subnatura reproduce through convergence: anima + belief + disaster = birth.

Ceremonial convergence is public and planned. Emotional convergence is private, spontaneous, and **spiritually potent**—often resulting in rare and mythic offspring. Some regions fear emotional convergence, calling it _the soulquake_.

---

## Regional Faith and Worship (Expanded)

Each Child’s domain is **geographically isolated**. The Allflame may be worshiped in the volcanic isles of Raethos, but never beyond. These worshippers often form **entire cultures** around the environmental demands of their Child:

- **Allflame followers** walk barefoot across coals during oaths.
    
- **Alsno cults** live in silence, mimicking snowfall.
    
- **Algyre monks** move only in spirals and never walk in straight lines.
    
- **Algaea acolytes** only speak through plants grown from their own hair.
























Natura comes from the word natural, without the letter "l", signifying without life. Natura are without life, yet still Huma suggest they contain a soul due to their ability to represent characteristics of consciousness and intelligence. Elementals are spawned through convergence, a reincarnation process.

Natura Stoicism, with the exception of release being during ceremonies.


### Origin

  

### Natural Convergence

Natura reproduce through ceremonial infusions of potent anima into the elements, called natural convergence. This results in natural disasters, centered around the theme of the ceremonial infusion. For example, rock Natura would likely revolve their ceremonies around earthquakes, pumping anima into the earth in order to spawn more rock elementals during the disaster. These events are called mass spawns or spawn disasters and they are always caused by Natura. Additionally, the anima that is placed by Natura into their desired medium is affected by their beliefs, sometimes altering their spawn and the type of disaster to occur, most often to the Natura’s advantage. Natura can also reproduce through individual means, but this requires a large output of potent anima through an emotional release. Similarly to the ceremonial process, this variation of emotional convergence process also resorts in beliefs entering the young elemental, however in this case it is much more potent. Through process of emotional release comes from the creation of Natura, as told in the Goda Mythos.  




Worship the Allmother. Although, some may also worship the Allmother's children, referred to as the Allflame, Alsno, Alroc, Alice (just as examples. sometimes with shortened, humanized names for better understanding). Worshippers of the Allmother's children group uniquely. Worshippers of the Allflame, for example, can only be found in one location, never would another region also worship the Allflame. This is the same with all other children (who each represent an element). 





# Subnatura



the base of all natura is [[Almauder]] which comes from the name Allmother

There is a reputation ranking system through all natura. These come with rewards and benefits and act like boons.

1. Ally - You will not be considered immediately hostile to the element type.
2. Acolyte - You have advantage on intelligent checks to uncover information about the element type.
3. Adept - You receive resistance to the element type.
4. Archon - Merchant System
5. Allfather (representing taking the place of the Almauder's child, as ruler of the element) - You receive immunity to the element type.







Natural are defined by their relationship to the other kingdoms, as the environment itself is without moral. This means, the natural happenings that occur due to the disaster is not inherently influenced by the Natura’s ideology. Instead, the ideology of the Natura is in response to the state of their All on other kingdoms.

Each All is only one soul. The mother is also her own soul. To become an All you must replace the old one’s soul through a movement that brings about greater change. It is a scoreboard that ranks changes to the environment. The creature who is capable of causing the most change can become the next all.
