**Bin:** [[Scape]]

Jeti Sound is the tropical coastal region between and extending just beyond [[Kyre's Point]] and [[Luin's Point]], forming the southernmost edge of [[Scender]]. Known for its sandy beaches, warm waters, and rich tropical life, the Sound thrives as a hub of trade, spiritual pilgrimage, and cultural exchange. The densest tropical growth is concentrated on the points themselves, where towering cliffs promote a diverse ecosystem. As one moves further from the Points, the coastal environment shifts into smoother beaches and the bustling commerce of [[Southcatch]].

## Geography and Structure

Jeti Sound is framed by two massive [[Aprimma]] jetties, natural formations that funnel ocean currents into the bay. These structures, along with the deep waters of the [[Swirling Sea]], create a natural harbor, protecting ships from rough tides. The bay is further connected to the city's core by a network of rivers that flow inward, linking Jeti Sound to Scender’s concentric bands until they reach the [[Ascension Band]].

The waters of Jeti Sound are teeming with life—schools of shimmering fish dart between reefs, while kelpdrakes and other aquatic Ferra move gracefully through the currents. The proximity to [[Kyre’s Point]] and [[Luin’s Point]] makes this one of the most biodiverse areas in Sancta, with both Bluma and Natura forming a distinct symbiotic ecosystem at the cliffsides.

## Southcatch: The Heart of Commerce

While Jeti Sound encompasses the entire bay, Southcatch is the port district where trade, travel, and economic life converge. It is a bustling center of activity, filled with docks, market stalls, and warehouses. The influence of the [[World Gyre]] is evident here, as ocean currents naturally carry ships toward the harbor, making Southcatch a vital economic artery for [[Sol Unita]].

With a mixture of permanent residents, transient merchants, and foreign dignitaries, Southcatch is the most culturally diverse district of Scender. Unlike Scender Proper, where religious observance is deeply woven into public life, Southcatch allows for a freer blend of traditions and trade, making it an attractive destination for travelers.

## The Asath Sanctuary and Gaudis Island

At the center of Jeti Sound lies [[Gaudis]], a small but sacred island home to the [[Asath Sanctuary]]. This revered temple, constructed of [[Sar Glass]] and Aprimma, stands as the holiest site in Asceptim faith. It is a place of pilgrimage, where worshippers undergo sacred rites and asylum seekers take their first steps toward conversion into Sol Unita.

The sanctuary is accessed through the [[Underflow]], an underwater tunnel that serves as both a literal and spiritual passage. The Underflow teems with aquatic life—Bluma and Ferra intertwine as bioluminescent flora pulses in the currents, and small Natura elementals swirl playfully in the water’s flow. The tunnel represents deliberate transition, a space where one moves against the natural currents to find spiritual stillness before reaching the sanctuary.

## Trade and Economic Influence

Jeti Sound is the gateway to Sol Unita’s wealth, with goods flowing through its ports from every corner of Toma. It is especially renowned for its trade in [[Hollow Resource]]s, a commodity that fuels the city’s technological and religious infrastructure. Due to the high value of these materials, trade through Jeti Sound is heavily regulated, with specialized inspections to prevent smuggling.

Other major goods include Apex-Praeda seafood, textiles, and raw minerals sourced from the Swirling Sea. Airships frequently dock at the trade platforms extending from Luin’s Point, bringing additional resources and travelers.
