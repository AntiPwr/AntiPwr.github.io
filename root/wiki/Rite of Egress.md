## Historical Context

The Rite of Egress originates from the exile of [[Huma]] from Endem, a subterranean world that was abandoned just prior to the [[Line from Few]] and the [[World Gyre]] shift. This event was seen as both a physical migration and a spiritual ascension, where those who reached the surface were given a new chance at life. Those who attempted to return to Endem were lost forever, reinforcing the belief that returning to past suffering leads only to destruction.

This concept was later adopted as a legal and societal framework within Sol Unita, ensuring that those who escape hardship are encouraged to move forward, not backward.

## Role in Governance and Refugee Policies

The Rite of Egress is a foundational principle in Scender’s approach to asylum seekers. Those who flee to Scender seeking refuge are given one week to prove their need for protection or their potential societal value. Those who fail to meet these criteria are relocated to growing settlements beyond Scender’s walls, where they can receive support but are barred from re-entering the capital.

This system ensures that Scender remains a beacon of progress while still offering aid to those in need. Refugees who successfully integrate into Scender are provided citizenship pathways through education, work placement, and religious programs, aligning with the belief that growth is rewarded when one moves forward.

## Personal and Philosophical Meaning

On an individual level, the Rite of Egress reinforces the idea that personal growth requires leaving behind past struggles. It teaches that those who dwell on past pain or refuse to embrace change will never truly ascend.

Many within Sol Unita apply this rite in their daily lives—whether in relationships, careers, or spiritual journeys—believing that one must move forward and never regress. This philosophy is reflected in the [[Asceptim]] faith, where ascension is only achievable through continuous progression.

## Cultural Significance

The fear of regression is deeply ingrained in Scender’s people, making this rite one of the most widely accepted. Stories of those who attempted to return to Endem serve as cautionary tales, warning of self-destruction and loss of purpose. This belief extends beyond refugees—it applies to anyone who refuses to adapt, improve, or move beyond their failures.

Because of its significance, the Rite of Egress plays a key role in education, religious practice, and governance, ensuring that Sol Unita remains focused on the future rather than the past.

## Legacy and Influence

The Rite of Egress has had lasting effects on Sol Unita’s policies and Scender’s cultural identity. It continues to shape how leaders, citizens, and asylum seekers interact with their society. The principle of never returning to hardship remains one of the most defining aspects of Scender’s social structure, reinforcing empathy, resilience, and a forward-thinking approach to governance.

This rite is often cited alongside the [[Rite of Passage]], emphasizing that true ascension is only possible when one fully embraces the path forward and never looks back.
