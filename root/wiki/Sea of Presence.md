## Description

The Sea of Presence is famed for its warm, nutrient-rich waters and its thriving ecosystems. It is a vital source of food, trade, and inspiration for the peoples of Toma. The sea is bordered by the Eternal Straits, which connect it to the [[Swirling Sea]].

## Eternal Straits

The Eternal Straits are four waterways that link the Swirling Sea to the Sea of Presence. The southernmost, Trader's Tollway, is taxed by the [[Tayim Trade Republic]]. These straits are major arteries for commerce and migration.

## Cultural Significance

The Sea of Presence is a symbol of abundance, opportunity, and connection. Its shores are home to diverse societies, including the [[Pearl Natura Society]] and the Sea Walker people, who worship [[Lopali]].
