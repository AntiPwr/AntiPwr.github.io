**Phylum**:  **Ashprahm**  ([[Primalism and Advancism|Primalism]] and [[Innerdualism]])  

Ashprahm is a belief system rooted in **Primalism** and **Innerdualism**, focusing on harmonizing primal forces with inner balance. Followers of Ashprahm believe in connecting with nature's core essence through spiritual practices that emphasize the synergy between primal and internal energy. The faith centers on self-mastery, spiritual cleansing, and maintaining equilibrium between opposing primal forces.

Ashprahm is notably distinct from the more modern beliefs that arose from the [[Tayim Trade Republic]] and [[Babadoo Slim]] following the destruction of [[Old Badaba]]. It serves as a counter to the more technocratic and rational systems that emerged within [[Anosdi]] and [[Asceptim]].

### Ideology

The followers of Ashprahm are highly superstitious, believing that the primal forces within each individual must be balanced to achieve harmony. This system of belief is heavily influenced by the natural elements and supernatural forces that surround them, leading to rituals and rites that focus on the inner spirit and its connection to the primal.


### Core Beliefs

At the heart of Ashprahm is the idea that the natural world’s primal forces must be harnessed and respected in order to achieve spiritual enlightenment. Its followers practice rituals designed to align their inner spirits with the primal forces of nature, believing that true power comes from balance. Ashprahm rejects technological advancements and seeks to return to a more primal state of existence, where nature’s forces guide the evolution of the soul.

This belief system is deeply superstitious, with many practices involving charms, rituals, and sacrifices designed to appease natural and supernatural entities. 

### Conflict with Advancism

Ashprahm directly opposes the beliefs of [[Anosdi]], which promote technological growth and the harnessing of unnatural forces to advance society. This ideological divide has led to numerous conflicts between Ashprahm followers and those who seek to push civilization into a more advanced state.

### Subphylum: Oshe

On [[Babadoo Slim]], [[Oshe]] is the only subphylum of Ashprahm, focusing on occult practices that blend rituals of nature and spirit. This spiritual remnant continues to influence the islanders through occult traditions, shaping their relationship with the primal world.

### Inspiration

The **Ashprahm** belief system is inspired by **Hinduism**, focusing on themes of balance, karma, and sacrifice. It draws on the concept of internal and external harmony with nature, as well as superstitions that link the physical world to the spiritual and emotional states of its followers.
