The Nesa are powerful interplanar deities within the [[Toman Ecoss]], serving as the <!--lesser--> gods who oversee and influence the laws of life, nature, belief, and anim. Their presence is integral to the balance and dynamics of the plane, acting as both guardians and enforcers of cosmic harmony.

<!--
## Origin and Mythos

In the beginning, when [[Zlellis and O'numeume]] first clashed to form the plane of [[Toma]], their immense cosmic energies formed personifications of the core aspects of their argument. These ripples resonated from the [[Fractal Waters]], where the [[Goda]] dwell, into the [[Sacrus]] and began to form seeds of new divine beings. These seeds slowly grew during the time of the [[Natural War]].

The Goda, intrigued by these nascent entities, later saw an opportunity to further understand their own existence and the nature of creation. Once the beginning Nesa were established, the gradient of belief and [[Anim]] had been altered for eternity. Through their existence, belief events became a natural occurrence, when prior to the Nesa there was only one possible event: ascension.

Since the Nesa were made in the likeness of the Goda, a wide range of belief events became possible through the core foundations of their planar creation and argument. This diversity of potential spiritual experiences fundamentally transformed how consciousness interacts with the fabric of reality in Toma.

## Nature and Characteristics

### Appearance

Nesa are typically seen in their avatar forms, each reflecting the domains they govern and the beliefs they embody. <!--Their forms are highly complex and approaching a completely psychedelic appearance, as they exist within Sacrus and its spatial dimension, as seen through third-dimensional perception (see [[Trenjor and Voyimus#Trenjor|Trenjor]] and [[Spatial Equivalence]]). -->

Their manifestations often incorporate:

- Multiple simultaneous geometries 
- Impossible color spectrums visible only to those attuned to their specific frequencies
- Symbolic elements that represent their domains and powers
- Physical characteristics that shift according to observer perception

When interacting with mortal beings, most Nesa adopt simplified avatars that can be comprehended by limited consciousness, though even these forms often retain an otherworldly quality that marks them as clearly divine.

### Activity Cycles

Generally, Nesa are most active during the beginning of Lines, with their influence gradually diminishing as each Line progresses. This waning presence often leads to a corresponding decline in faith among mortal populations, which is typically only restored through Line shifts when the Dance of Spira changes direction. The only exception to this natural cycle are so-called Onesa, or Demon Nesa.

This cyclical pattern of divine engagement and withdrawal creates a natural rhythm to religious experience in Toma, with periods of intense divine manifestation followed by eras where faith must persist despite reduced intervention from the Nesa.


## Sanctan Culture

Theology, as it is understood (in the [[Current Line]]), through [[Sol Unita|Sol Unita's]] dominant culture, is heavily influenced by [[Astalt's Theory of the Kingdoms]] (often shortened to "ATK" in discussion), which is a set of 

These self-published book by [[Reno Astalt]]

### Nesa of Fealty

The Nesa of Fealty are those who have claimed greater responsibilities from the Fractal Waters through [[Source Surge Types#Nascension|Nascension]]. These responsibilities, once held by the Goda of Toma, have been lifted from them through interaction on the plane, freeing the Goda of responsibility by achieving self-sufficiency on the plane.

Each Nesa of Fealty governs specific aspects of life and nature, ensuring the ongoing balance and harmony of Toma. Their ascension to this status represented a crucial evolutionary step for the plane itself, marking the transition from direct divine management to a more complex theological ecosystem.

### Nesa of Duality

The Nesa of Duality embody dichotomous relationships. They represent opposing forces or concepts that together create balance and completeness. These entities often exist within other classifications such as the Nesa of Kingdoms and Nesa of Fealty.

Notable Nesa of Duality include:

- [[Apex and Praeda]] (Predator and Prey) – Governing the natural cycles of consumption and survival
- [[Trenjor and Voyimus]] (Acceptance and Ignorance/Truth and Falsity) – Overseeing the balance between knowledge and mystery

These paired deities demonstrate how opposing forces can be complementary rather than contradictory, each requiring the other to maintain cosmic equilibrium.

### Nesa of Kingdoms

The Nesa of Kingdoms represent specific kingdoms within the Toman Ecoss. They embody the essence and characteristics of their respective kingdoms, guiding their evolution and interactions throughout the plane's history.

Examples include:

- [[Chantae]] ([[Celia]]) – Representing decomposition, recycling, and the transformative aspects of death
- [[Never]] ([[Ka'Vit]]) – Governing the transition of souls and their journey through the afterlife

These kingdom-specific Nesa serve as both patrons and personifications of their respective domains, their personalities and actions reflecting the fundamental nature of the kingdoms they represent.

## Organization and Relationships

The Nesa operate like a large, dysfunctional family, each with unique personalities and motives tied to their domains. Their interactions are characterized by:

- Complex alliances and rivalries that shift over time
- Overlapping spheres of influence that create both cooperation and conflict
- Varying degrees of interest in or concern for mortal affairs
- Personal agendas that may align with or contradict the broader cosmic order

While the Nesa generally work to maintain the overall balance of Toma, individual Nesa often have competing visions for how this balance should be structured. These disagreements can manifest as natural disasters, unusual phenomena, or periods of religious upheaval when multiple Nesa attempt to influence mortal societies simultaneously.

## Cultural Understanding

### Usakan Etymology

The term "Nesa" itself has Usakan origins, emerging from early High Dweller communities' attempts to classify the divine beings they encountered. The word derives from the ancient Usakan root "nes-" meaning "to speak from beyond" or "voice that crosses boundaries."

This linguistic connection highlights the historical significance of [[Usaka]] as one of the earliest regions to develop sophisticated theological frameworks for understanding these entities. To this day, Usakan theologians—particularly those based in [[Hypri]]—maintain some of the most comprehensive records of Nesa manifestations and behaviors.

### Regional Variations

Different cultures throughout Toma have developed varied understandings and names for the Nesa:

- In [[Sol Unita]], they are often categorized according to their relationship with [[Asath]] and the [[Rites of Huma]]
- The [[Branches of Concordia]] focus on their hierarchical arrangement and cosmic responsibilities
<!--- [[Chain of Delta]] traditions emphasize their practical influences on trade, travel, and material prosperity-->
- [[Tayim Trade Republic]] scholars study their manifestations as natural phenomena with predictable patterns

These diverse perspectives reflect not only cultural differences but also the multifaceted nature of the Nesa themselves, who often present different aspects of their being to different societies.

The [[Nesa]] are powerful interplanar deities within the [[Toman Ecoss]], serving as lesser gods who oversee and influence the laws of life, nature, and belief. Their presence is integral to the balance and dynamics of the plane, acting as both guardians and enforcers of cosmic harmony.

### Origin and Mythos

In the beginning, when [[Zlellis and O'nume]] first clashed to form the plane of [[Scape (TTRPG)/1 Purpose Taxonomy/Complete Taxonomy/02 Eco/01 Toman Ecoss/02 Toma/Toma]], their immense cosmic energies formed personifications of the core aspects of their argument. These ripples resonated from the [[Fractal Waters]], where the [[Goda]] dwell, into the [[Sacrus]] and began to form seeds of new divine beings. These seeds slowly grew during the time of the [[Natural War]]. The Goda, intrigued by these nascent entities, later saw an opportunity to further understand their own existence and the nature of creation, as well as find benefits. Once the beginning Nesa were established, the gradient of belief and [[Anim]] had been altered for eternity. Through their existence, belief events became a natural occurrence, when prior to the Nesa there was only one possible event: ascension. Since the Nesa were made in the likeness of the Goda, a wide range of belief events became possible through the core foundations of their planar creation and argument.

### Appearance

Nesa are typically seen in their avatar forms, each reflecting the domains they govern and the beliefs they embody. Their forms are highly complex and approaching a completely psychedelic appearance, as they exist within Sacrus, and its spatial dimension, as seen through third dimensional perception (see [[Trenjor and Voyimus#Trenjor|Trenjor]] and [[Spatial Equivalence]]), and are constantly approaching the Fractal Waters. Their forms are often ethereal and otherworldly, embodying the nature of their domains and the cosmic forces they represent.

### Fealty

The Nesa are a classification of Nesa who have claimed greater responsibilities from the Fractal Waters through [[Source Surge Types#Nascension|Nascension]]. These responsibilities, once held by the Goda of Toma, have been lifted from them through interaction on the plane, freeing the Goda of responsibility by achieving self-sufficiency on the plane. Each Nesa of Fealty governs specific aspects of life and nature, ensuring the ongoing balance and harmony of Toma.

### Nesa of Duality

The Nesa of Duality are lesser gods that embody dichotomous relationships, similar to Zero and One. They often represent opposing forces or concepts, existing within other classifications such as the Nesa of Kingdoms and Nesa of Fealty. The Nesa of Duality include:

- [[Apex and Praeda]] (Predator and Prey)
- [[Trenjor and Voyimus]] (Acceptance and Ignorance/Truth and Falsity)

### Nesa of Kingdoms

The Nesa of Kingdoms are deities who represent specific kingdoms within the Toman Ecoss. They embody the essence and characteristics of their respective kingdoms, guiding their evolution and interactions. The Nesa of Kingdoms include:

- [[Chantae]] ([[Celia]])
- [[Never]] ([[Ka'Vit]])

### Organization and Relationships

The Nesa operate like a large, dysfunctional family, each with unique personalities and motives tied to their domains. Their complex relationships and interactions often shape the dynamics and events within the Toman Ecoss. While some Nesa work in harmony, others may have conflicting agendas, reflecting the intricate balance of power and influence they wield.

### Influence and Legacy

The presence of the Nesa is a defining characteristic of the Toman Ecoss, influencing the evolution and development of the plane. Through their actions and decisions, they shape the course of history and the beliefs of the inhabitants. The Nesa's role as guardians and enforcers of cosmic harmony ensures the ongoing balance and stability of the plane, guiding its inhabitants toward growth and enlightenment.





# Subnesa










Nesa are more active during the start of lines. This means they are less active as the line progresses, leading to loss of faith which is typically only restored through line shifts.
