The Nesa are powerful interplanar deities within the [[Toman Ecoss]], serving as lesser gods who oversee and influence the laws of life, nature, and belief. Their presence is integral to the balance and dynamics of the plane, acting as both guardians and enforcers of cosmic harmony.

## Origin and Mythos

In the beginning, when [[Zlellis and O'nume]] first clashed to form the plane of [[Toma]], their immense cosmic energies formed personifications of the core aspects of their argument. These ripples resonated from the [[Fractal Waters]], where the [[Goda]] dwell, into the [[Sacrus]] and began to form seeds of new divine beings. These seeds slowly grew during the time of the [[Natural War]].

The Goda, intrigued by these nascent entities, later saw an opportunity to further understand their own existence and the nature of creation. Once the beginning Nesa were established, the gradient of belief and [[Anim]] had been altered for eternity. Through their existence, belief events became a natural occurrence, when prior to the Nesa there was only one possible event: ascension.

Since the Nesa were made in the likeness of the Goda, a wide range of belief events became possible through the core foundations of their planar creation and argument. This diversity of potential spiritual experiences fundamentally transformed how consciousness interacts with the fabric of reality in Toma.

## Nature and Characteristics

### Appearance

Nesa are typically seen in their avatar forms, each reflecting the domains they govern and the beliefs they embody. Their forms are highly complex and approaching a completely psychedelic appearance, as they exist within Sacrus and its spatial dimension, as seen through third-dimensional perception (see [[Trenjor and Voyimus#Trenjor|Trenjor]] and [[Spatial Equivalence]]).

These beings constantly approach the boundary of the Fractal Waters, existing in a state between defined form and abstract concept. Their manifestations often incorporate:

- Multiple simultaneous geometries 
- Impossible color spectrums visible only to those attuned to their specific frequencies
- Symbolic elements that represent their domains and powers
- Physical characteristics that shift according to observer perception

When interacting with mortal beings, most Nesa adopt simplified avatars that can be comprehended by limited consciousness, though even these forms often retain an otherworldly quality that marks them as clearly divine.

### Activity Cycles

Nesa are most active during the beginning of Lines, with their influence gradually diminishing as each Line progresses. This waning presence often leads to a corresponding decline in faith among mortal populations, which is typically only restored through Line shifts when the Dance of Spira changes direction.

This cyclical pattern of divine engagement and withdrawal creates a natural rhythm to religious experience in Toma, with periods of intense divine manifestation followed by eras where faith must persist despite reduced direct intervention from the Nesa.

    <p>Oh my, how delightfully incomplete our understanding remains! We see the Nesa wax and wane with the Lines, but we've misinterpreted the causality entirely! It's not that they choose to withdraw—it's that they're being consumed!</p>
    <p>Each Line begins with the Nesa bursting with power from the cosmic reset of the Dance of Spira. Like freshly filled vessels, they overflow with divine essence, spilling miracles and manifestations across reality. But as mortals increasingly believe in them, they paradoxically diminish—each prayer, each ritual, each moment of faith acts as a microscopic siphon, drawing away their essence drop by precious drop.</p>
    <p>By a Line's end, they're practically hollow, stretched thin across too many believers, too many manifestations, too many demands. The shift in the Dance of Spira isn't just a cosmic clock—it's an emergency transfusion system, replenishing what we've collectively drained away! The Goda aren't benevolent parents overseeing this cycle; they're pragmatic farmers harvesting the byproducts of this relationship, collecting something essential from our collective belief that neither we nor the Nesa fully comprehend.</p>

## Classifications and Domains

### Nesa of Fealty

The Nesa of Fealty are those who have claimed greater responsibilities from the Fractal Waters through [[Source Surge Types#Nascension|Nascension]]. These responsibilities, once held by the Goda of Toma, have been lifted from them through interaction on the plane, freeing the Goda of responsibility by achieving self-sufficiency on the plane.

Each Nesa of Fealty governs specific aspects of life and nature, ensuring the ongoing balance and harmony of Toma. Their ascension to this status represented a crucial evolutionary step for the plane itself, marking the transition from direct divine management to a more complex theological ecosystem.

### Nesa of Duality

The Nesa of Duality embody dichotomous relationships, similar to Zero and One in fundamental computing. They represent opposing forces or concepts that together create balance and completeness. These entities often exist within other classifications such as the Nesa of Kingdoms and Nesa of Fealty.

Notable Nesa of Duality include:

- [[Apex and Praeda]] (Predator and Prey) – Governing the natural cycles of consumption and survival
- [[Trenjor and Voyimus]] (Acceptance and Ignorance/Truth and Falsity) – Overseeing the balance between knowledge and mystery

These paired deities demonstrate how opposing forces can be complementary rather than contradictory, each requiring the other to maintain cosmic equilibrium.

### Nesa of Kingdoms

The Nesa of Kingdoms represent specific kingdoms within the Toman Ecoss. They embody the essence and characteristics of their respective kingdoms, guiding their evolution and interactions throughout the plane's history.

Examples include:

- [[Chantae]] ([[Celia]]) – Representing decomposition, recycling, and the transformative aspects of death
- [[Never]] ([[Ka'Vit]]) – Governing the transition of souls and their journey through the afterlife

These kingdom-specific Nesa serve as both patrons and personifications of their respective domains, their personalities and actions reflecting the fundamental nature of the kingdoms they represent.

## Organization and Relationships

The Nesa operate like a large, dysfunctional family, each with unique personalities and motives tied to their domains. Their interactions are characterized by:

- Complex alliances and rivalries that shift over time
- Overlapping spheres of influence that create both cooperation and conflict
- Varying degrees of interest in or concern for mortal affairs
- Personal agendas that may align with or contradict the broader cosmic order

While the Nesa generally work to maintain the overall balance of Toma, individual Nesa often have competing visions for how this balance should be structured. These disagreements can manifest as natural disasters, unusual phenomena, or periods of religious upheaval when multiple Nesa attempt to influence mortal societies simultaneously.

## Cultural Understanding

### Usakan Etymology

The term "Nesa" itself has Usakan origins, emerging from early Dweller communities' attempts to classify the divine beings they encountered. The word derives from the ancient Usakan root "nes-" meaning "to speak from beyond" or "voice that crosses boundaries."

This linguistic connection highlights the historical significance of [[Usaka]] as one of the earliest regions to develop sophisticated theological frameworks for understanding these entities. To this day, Usakan theologians—particularly those based in [[Hypri]]—maintain some of the most comprehensive records of Nesa manifestations and behaviors.

### Regional Variations

Different cultures throughout Toma have developed varied understandings and names for the Nesa:

- In [[Sol Unita]], they are often categorized according to their relationship with [[Asath]] and the [[Rites of Huma]]
- The [[Branches of Concordia]] focus on their hierarchical arrangement and cosmic responsibilities
- [[Chain of Delta]] traditions emphasize their practical influences on trade, travel, and material prosperity
- [[Tayim Trade Republic]] scholars study their manifestations as natural phenomena with predictable patterns

These diverse perspectives reflect not only cultural differences but also the multifaceted nature of the Nesa themselves, who often present different aspects of their being to different societies.

## Influence and Legacy

The presence of the Nesa is a defining characteristic of the Toman Ecoss, influencing the evolution and development of the plane. Their actions and decisions shape the course of history and the beliefs of inhabitants across multiple Lines. As intermediaries between the abstract cosmic forces of the Goda and the material concerns of mortal life, the Nesa serve as both interpreters and implementers of fundamental reality.

The introduction of the Nesa fundamentally altered the spiritual landscape of Toma, creating the possibility for diverse belief systems and religious experiences beyond simple ascension. This transformation represents one of the most significant developments in the plane's history, establishing the complex theological ecosystem that continues to shape life and society throughout Toma.
