## Overview and Command

Kleznit is the northeastern Omep Region of Delta, reserved for government and military operations. It is led by [[Aj'iru]], the Arch (Triarch) of Kleznit, who is both a regional warlord and a key enforcer of the Medan's will. Aj'iru is known for their strategic acumen, adaptability, and strict adherence to the doctrine of the Chain. Under Aj'iru's command, Kleznit serves as the nerve center of Delta’s military power, with its soldiers being heavily drugged, conditioned, and subjected to advanced forms of psychological and magical control.

The Kleznit Advance is infamous for its integration of [[Feignedfolk]]—Willed-Mecha, undead, and other will-suppressed entities—into its ranks. This reflects the regime’s broader use of [[Credomancy]] and social engineering, as pioneered by [[Fuscia Lustin]], to suppress autonomy and create a force that is both loyal and relentless.

## Will-Suppression, Social Engineering, and Feignedfolk

The discipline and loyalty of the Kleznit Advance are enforced not only through physical training and execution lines, but also through advanced psychological conditioning and magical control. [[Credomancy]] is used to suppress the will of both soldiers and Feignedfolk, ensuring absolute obedience. The integration of Feignedfolk—entities lacking true willpower—into the ranks is a hallmark of Kleznit’s military doctrine, reflecting the regime’s broader strategy of will-suppression and social engineering as described in [[Chain of Delta]].

Aj'iru, as Arch, is both a practitioner and enforcer of these methods, working closely with the Medan to maintain the unity and effectiveness of the Advance. The result is a force that is both feared and respected across Wyldere, known for its unwavering discipline and the seamless integration of human and non-human soldiers.

As a continental army, the Kleznit Advance is infamous for its ruthless enforcement of discipline and loyalty on the battlefield. When the army advances—often across the open, snow-laden plains of Wyldere—a strict military execution line is established behind the main force. This line is composed of elite spellsnipers and loyal militants whose sole duty is to eliminate any soldier who attempts to defect, retreat without orders, or otherwise betray the Chain. The presence of this execution line ensures that allegiance to the state is absolute and that the security of information and military cohesion is never compromised.

Desertion is considered one of the deepest forms of treason within the Chain of Delta, punishable by immediate death. The execution line is both a psychological and physical barrier, reinforcing the doctrine that the will of the Chain is paramount and that individual survival is always subordinate to the unity and secrecy of the Advance. This system, while brutal, is credited with maintaining the legendary discipline and fearsome reputation of the Kleznit Advance throughout the continent.

## Military Ranks of the Kleznit Advance

The military hierarchy of the Kleznit Advance mirrors that of the Chain of Delta, blending political, spiritual, and martial authority. The presence of Feignedfolk and the use of advanced photometal implants further distinguish Kleznit’s forces from those of other regions.

The Kleznit Advance follows the Chain of Delta’s strict military hierarchy, with each rank reflecting a blend of political, spiritual, and martial authority:

### Tier I — Divine Authority
**Medan – Archangel of Delta:** Supreme Commander of all military and spiritual operations. (Currently [[Fuscia Lustin]])

**Saint-of-Purpose – Wartime Apostle:** Rare spiritual commander, extension of the Medan’s will (e.g., [[Kee]]).

**Arch – First Anchor:** Regional warlord and governor-general of an Omep region, subordinate to the Medan and Saint of Purpose. (Currently [[Aj'iru]] for Kleznit)

### Tier II — Judgment Command
**Fog Vicar:** Overseer of doctrinal warfare, propaganda, adversarial social engineering, and photometal development.

**Cladkin:** Commander of major war theaters and campaigns.

**Saint (Systems Tactician):** Senior logistics and supply tactician.

**Solutioner:** Oversees Death Marches and morale in failed sectors. <!-- The solutioner has a reaper-like appearance -->

### Tier III — Chain Captains
### Mech Armor Ranks
**Grand Officer:** Elite guide and commander, often chosen for intelligence over brute strength. Grand Officers are typically selected from the successful population of Rasm, not Almalek, and are given specialized training that skips the standard Kleznit physical regimen. They are equipped with advanced mech armor and have the authority to lead other foot units in combat, especially in harsh winter conditions and the snowy sheets of Wyldere, as well as the Summons Mountain Range. Grand Officers are valued for their strategic acumen and adaptability, making them essential during large-scale operations in extreme environments.

**Grand Admiral:** The highest mech armor rank, personally chosen by Aj'iru. The Grand Admiral commands the most advanced mechanized units and is responsible for leading major offensives and critical missions. This rank is reserved for those who have demonstrated exceptional leadership and tactical skill. Grand Admirals are rare and serve as the ultimate authority among the mechanized forces of the Kleznit Advance.

Grand Officers and Grand Admirals are distinct from other ranks in that their training and selection process is tailored to their unique roles. Grand Officers, in particular, bypass the grueling physical training endured by most soldiers from Almalek, instead focusing on advanced strategy, technology, and command. In contrast, nearly all soldiers from Almalek are subjected to intense physical regimens, preparing them for frontline combat—a harsh experience, though often considered an improvement over life in their home region. The Grand Admiral, as the highest mechanized rank, is a direct extension of Aj'iru's authority and is responsible for the most critical missions and offensives.

**Serrat:** Division commander of drugged infantry.

**Splicer:** Officer of mixed-kingdom [[resonance]] units.

**Gate Phaser:** Controls military exits and movement in/out of Kleznit.

**Warden:** Operations officer for internal security and detention.

### Tier V — Rank-and-File
**Chainlink:** Standard drug-conditioned soldier.

Chainlink is an omnipresent role within the Kleznit Advance. Once achieved, a Chainlink can be promoted or assigned to any other military role. Every Chainlink is always paired with exactly two other partners, forming a triad that balances training, operational duties, and personal development. This system is designed to build strong, resilient connections between soldiers and military personnel, fostering loyalty and mutual reliance. No two military personnel share the same two partners; each triad is unique. The process of forming these triads begins early in military training, with recruits often pulled from Rasm and Almalek and assigned to their lifelong partners from the outset of their service.

**Flashplate:** Shock infantry for rebellion suppression and territory capture.

**Claspbearer:** Guard of political officers and relics.

**Link:** Trainee, often from Rasm or Almalek.

### Tier Null — Unofficial/Shadow Ranks**

**Crank:** Destroys heretical targets and locations through self-destructive acts.

**Bleaker:** One-way mission operative, presumed dead on dispatch.

## Continental Operations and Military Execution Line

The Kleznit Advance is structured to operate as a continental defensive force, capable of rapid mobilization and sustained campaigns over regions of interest across the harsh environments of Wyldere. Its operations are defined by a doctrine of absolute discipline, enforced through both psychological and physical means.

When the army advances upon another army, a strict military execution line is established behind the main force. This line is composed of elite spellsnipers and loyal militants whose sole duty is to eliminate any soldier who attempts to defect, retreat without orders, or otherwise betray the Chain. The execution line serves as both a psychological deterrent and a physical barrier, ensuring that allegiance to the state is never questioned and that the security of information and military cohesion is never compromised. This principle, known as [[Deathground]], has evolved from an ethnocentric vision for Vokar started by the settlers of Delta, which la [[Deathground]]

Orders are relayed with precision, and any deviation is met with immediate and severe consequences. The presence of the execution line instills a deep sense of fear and unity among the ranks, reinforcing the doctrine that the will of the Chain is paramount and that individual survival is always subordinate to the unity and secrecy of the Advance.

Desertion is considered one of the gravest forms of treason within the Kleznit Advance, punishable by immediate death. This system, while brutal, is credited with maintaining the legendary discipline and fearsome reputation of the Advance throughout the continent. The operational effectiveness of the Kleznit Advance is further enhanced by its integration of Feignedfolk and the use of advanced magical and psychological conditioning, making it one of the most formidable military forces in Wyldere.

The Kleznit Advance operates as a continental army, renowned for its ruthless efficiency and strict enforcement of discipline across the vast, snow-laden plains of Wyldere. Its operational doctrine is built on the principle of absolute loyalty to the Chain of Delta, enforced through both psychological and physical means.

When the Kleznit Advance mobilizes, it does so with a clear chain of command and a rigid execution protocol. Behind the main force, a military execution line is established—composed of elite spellsnipers and loyal militants. Their sole duty is to eliminate any soldier who attempts to defect, retreat without orders, or otherwise betray the Chain. This execution line acts as both a psychological deterrent and a physical barrier, ensuring that allegiance to the state is never questioned and that the security of information and military cohesion is never compromised.

The Advance is infamous for its ability to maintain order even in the most chaotic and hostile environments. Orders are relayed with precision, and any deviation is met with immediate and severe consequences.

## Imperial Imagery and Attire

<img src="wiki_images/Kleznit Advance Armor (Footsoldier).png"></img>


The armor of the Kleznit Advance is a striking ensemble of blackened metal and deep purple cloth, designed to project both authority and intimidation. The cuirass is crafted from overlapping plates of matte black metal, contoured to the torso and reinforced at the shoulders with broad, segmented pauldrons. Beneath the armor, soldiers wear a tunic of rich, dark purple, the sleeves and hem visible beneath the protective layers.

Dispatched soldiers are further equipped with gloves featuring sharpened metal fingertips, each shaped to resemble the talons of a crow. These gauntlets serve both as a weapon in close combat and as a visual symbol of the Advance’s predatory, relentless nature. The metallic claws glint against the dark armor, reinforcing the army’s connection to the crow motif and the doctrine of intimidation through unity and fear.

<img src="wiki_images/Kleznit Advance Armor (Gauntlet).png"></img>

Around the neck and upper chest, a mantle of black and dark purple feathers is arranged in layered rows, evoking the image of a predatory bird and signifying the wearer’s connection to [[Klesn]] and [[Kee]]. These feathers are interwoven with leather straps, which also serve as functional fastenings for the armor.

## Helmets and Mask Visages

While all Kleznit Advance soldiers wear protective helmets, the most formidable are reserved for high-ranking officers—those with direct influence over [[Willed-Mecha]] soldier operation and code. These officers don full-faced helmets of blackened metal, with sharply angular brows and sweeping crests of deep purple or black feathers. The mask-like visages are sculpted with stylized, expressionless features, giving the wearer an inhuman, statuesque appearance. Intricate engravings and raised patterns accentuate the brow, cheeks, and jawline, while the eye slits are narrow and shadowed, concealing the officer’s gaze. The crest, often made of horsehair or dyed feathers, rises in a dramatic arc from the crown, further enhancing the helmet’s imposing silhouette. These helmets serve as both a symbol of authority and a psychological weapon, erasing individual identity and presenting a unified, fearsome front to all who face the Kleznit Advance.

### Grand Officers and Augmented Mask Visages

<img src="wiki_images/Kleznit Advance Armor (Grand Officer).png"></img>

At the highest ranks, grand officers wear even more elaborate mask visages, inspired by the crow motif and designed to evoke both awe and dread. These masks feature elongated, beak-like projections and are fitted with a complex network of metal tubes and reinforced breathing apparatuses that connect directly into the armor and, in some cases, the wearer’s body. The tubes pulse with alchemical fluids and performance-enhancing compounds, visible through small glass vials or reservoirs embedded in the armor’s chest and back. The mask’s surface is adorned with intricate filigree and feather-like engravings, and the beak is often tipped with a sharpened metal point. Lenses or goggles cover the eyes, sometimes glowing faintly, and the entire ensemble is engineered to filter toxins, deliver stimulants, and regulate the officer’s physiology in battle. The result is a terrifying, almost mechanical visage that blends the image of a predatory bird with the relentless efficiency of a living war machine—an embodiment of the Kleznit Advance’s doctrine of power through strict allegiance, discipline, and technological mastery.

The arms are protected by bracers and vambraces of black metal, while the lower body is shielded by a skirt of leather strips reinforced with metal studs. Greaves cover the shins, and sturdy leather boots complete the ensemble. Each soldier carries a large, curved shield emblazoned with gold motifs—often featuring lightning, laurel, and teardrop designs—symbolizing power, victory, and mourning. The overall effect is one of disciplined menace, with every detail intended to inspire awe and fear on the battlefield.

The Kleznit Advance, or the Imperial Army of Delta, is heavily inspired by the Roman Praetorians.

Their clothing is inspired by the variation depicted in the movie Gladiator, with a slight twist relating to Kee. Due to the relation to Klesn and Kee, black and dark purple feathers adorn the armor and clothing as well, specifically around the neck similar to black leather straps.

Fuscia’s imperial armor is very similar, but instead of purple, is a darkened royal fuscia, separating him from the government, in order to subtly influence followers into believing he stands on his own against the official government. It is a symbolic choice, used to weave a consistent lie (mislead the public) seen in many other aspects of this society.
