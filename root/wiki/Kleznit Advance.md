## Continental Operations and Military Execution Line

As a continental army, the Kleznit Advance is infamous for its ruthless enforcement of discipline and loyalty on the battlefield. When the army advances—often across the open, snow-laden plains of Wyldere—a strict military execution line is established behind the main force. This line is composed of elite spellsnipers and loyal militants whose sole duty is to eliminate any soldier who attempts to defect, retreat without orders, or otherwise betray the Chain. The presence of this execution line ensures that allegiance to the state is absolute and that the security of information and military cohesion is never compromised.

Desertion is considered one of the deepest forms of treason within the Chain of Delta, punishable by immediate death. The execution line is both a psychological and physical barrier, reinforcing the doctrine that the will of the Chain is paramount and that individual survival is always subordinate to the unity and secrecy of the Advance. This system, while brutal, is credited with maintaining the legendary discipline and fearsome reputation of the Kleznit Advance throughout the continent.

## Imperial Imagery and Attire

<img src="wiki_images/Kleznit Advance Armor (Footsoldier).png"></img>


The armor of the Kleznit Advance is a striking ensemble of blackened metal and deep purple cloth, designed to project both authority and intimidation. The cuirass is crafted from overlapping plates of matte black metal, contoured to the torso and reinforced at the shoulders with broad, segmented pauldrons. Beneath the armor, soldiers wear a tunic of rich, dark purple, the sleeves and hem visible beneath the protective layers.

Dispatched soldiers are further equipped with gloves featuring sharpened metal fingertips, each shaped to resemble the talons of a crow. These gauntlets serve both as a weapon in close combat and as a visual symbol of the Advance’s predatory, relentless nature. The metallic claws glint against the dark armor, reinforcing the army’s connection to the crow motif and the doctrine of intimidation through unity and fear.

Around the neck and upper chest, a mantle of black and dark purple feathers is arranged in layered rows, evoking the image of a predatory bird and signifying the wearer’s connection to [[Klesn]] and [[Kee]]. These feathers are interwoven with leather straps, which also serve as functional fastenings for the armor.

## Helmets and Mask Visages

While all Kleznit Advance soldiers wear protective helmets, the most formidable are reserved for high-ranking officers—those with direct influence over [[Willed-Mecha]] soldier operation and code. These officers don full-faced helmets of blackened metal, with sharply angular brows and sweeping crests of deep purple or black feathers. The mask-like visages are sculpted with stylized, expressionless features, giving the wearer an inhuman, statuesque appearance. Intricate engravings and raised patterns accentuate the brow, cheeks, and jawline, while the eye slits are narrow and shadowed, concealing the officer’s gaze. The crest, often made of horsehair or dyed feathers, rises in a dramatic arc from the crown, further enhancing the helmet’s imposing silhouette. These helmets serve as both a symbol of authority and a psychological weapon, erasing individual identity and presenting a unified, fearsome front to all who face the Kleznit Advance.

### Grand Officers and Augmented Mask Visages

At the highest ranks, grand officers wear even more elaborate mask visages, inspired by the crow motif and designed to evoke both awe and dread. These masks feature elongated, beak-like projections and are fitted with a complex network of metal tubes and reinforced breathing apparatuses that connect directly into the armor and, in some cases, the wearer’s body. The tubes pulse with alchemical fluids and performance-enhancing compounds, visible through small glass vials or reservoirs embedded in the armor’s chest and back. The mask’s surface is adorned with intricate filigree and feather-like engravings, and the beak is often tipped with a sharpened metal point. Lenses or goggles cover the eyes, sometimes glowing faintly, and the entire ensemble is engineered to filter toxins, deliver stimulants, and regulate the officer’s physiology in battle. The result is a terrifying, almost mechanical visage that blends the image of a predatory bird with the relentless efficiency of a living war machine—an embodiment of the Kleznit Advance’s doctrine of power through strict allegiance, discipline, and technological mastery.

The arms are protected by bracers and vambraces of black metal, while the lower body is shielded by a skirt of leather strips reinforced with metal studs. Greaves cover the shins, and sturdy leather boots complete the ensemble. Each soldier carries a large, curved shield emblazoned with gold motifs—often featuring lightning, laurel, and teardrop designs—symbolizing power, victory, and mourning. The overall effect is one of disciplined menace, with every detail intended to inspire awe and fear on the battlefield.

## Fuscia Lustin’s Distinction

[[Fuscia Lustin]]’s imperial armor is very similar to that of the Kleznit Advance, but instead of purple, features a darkened royal fuscia. This subtle difference separates him from the government and is used to influence followers into believing he stands apart from the official regime. It is a symbolic choice, part of a broader strategy to mislead the public—a consistent lie woven throughout many aspects of this society.

The Kleznit Advance, or the Imperial Army of Delta, is heavily inspired by the Roman Praetorians.

Their clothing is inspired by the variation depicted in the movie Gladiator, with a slight twist relating to Kee. Due to the relation to Klesn and Kee, black and dark purple feathers adorn the armor and clothing as well, specifically around the neck similar to black leather straps.

Fuscia’s imperial armor is very similar, but instead of purple, is a darkened royal fuscia, separating him from the government, in order to subtly influence followers into believing he stands on his own against the official government. It is a symbolic choice, used to weave a consistent lie (mislead the public) seen in many other aspects of this society.
