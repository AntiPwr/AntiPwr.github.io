# Deck of the Allflame

**This deck is not complete and is in a conceptual state of development.**

_Forged by Laika Acker, this deck burns with the essence of Fire subnatura, embodying the chaotic beauty of combustion._

**Deck Theme:** Combustion, Fire, Natura
**Mechanics:** Stacking, Fire & Force Damage, Summoning

## **Core Stacks Mechanic**

Stacks represent an escalating exposure to the Allflame’s burning essence. As stacks accumulate on a creature, not only do they suffer additional fire damage each turn, but several card effects also scale based on the number of stacks consumed.  
When you see values written as _(a/b/c/…)_ in any card’s description, choose the number corresponding to the number of stacks used:

- **Example (Speed):** Consuming 1 stack grants **5 feet** extra movement; 2 stacks grant **10 feet**; 3 stacks grant **15 feet**; 4 stacks grant **20 feet**; and 5 stacks grant **25 feet**—in addition to the effect of disengage.

**Damage from Stacks at the Start of a Creature’s Turn:**

- **1 Stack:** 1d4 fire damage.
- **2 Stacks:** 1d6 fire damage.
- **3 Stacks:** 1d8 fire damage.
- **4 Stacks:** 1d10 fire damage.
- **5 Stacks:** 1d12 fire damage, and the creature’s AC is reduced by 1 (this reduction does not stack further).

_If Xerxes is in play (later explored), further stacking is possible:_

- **6 Stacks:** 2d12 fire damage at the start of the turn; AC reduction of 1.
- **7 Stacks:** 3d12 fire damage at the start of the turn; AC reduction of 1.

**Stack Removal:**  
A creature can remove 2 stacks by either dropping prone and rolling on the ground. By being fully submerged in water, all stacks can be removed. Combustion (force) effects are not lessened by dropping prone or submerging in water.

## **Individual Cards**

### **Ignition**
_The first spark of the Allflame. The fire’s hunger begins here._

- **Effect:** Target takes **1d6 fire damage** and gains **1 stack**.
- **Art Effect:** A small ember glows on the card’s surface, bursting briefly into a dancing flame before fading.

---

### **Burn**
_Fire spreads where there is fuel to consume._

- **Effect:** Target a creature that already has at least 1 stack. The flame leaps from that creature to **(1/2/3/4/5/6/7)** additional nearby creatures—each within **(10/15/20/25/30/35/40)** feet (depending on the number of stacks involved). Each affected creature gains **1 stack**.
- **Art Effect:** A single flame splits into multiple burning trails that extend outward before dissolving into sparks.

---

### **Fire Vortex (Concentration)**
_The spiral of combustion twists outward, seeking new life to consume._

- **Effect:**
    - Create a 10×10-foot vortex of flame extending in a straight 10-foot line from the caster. The vortex persists for 2 rounds.
    - Any creature that enters or starts its turn in the vortex takes **2d6 fire damage** and gains **1 stack**.
    - _Fire Elemental Interaction:_ If you have a fire elemental active, it can shift the vortex 10 feet as a bonus action.
    - **Deck Interaction:** After resolving this card, view the top card of your deck; you may choose to place it at the bottom.
- **Art Effect:** The artwork animates a swirling inferno that twists outward in a spiral of flame.

---

### **Fire Shield (Concentration)**
_Envelop yourself in a protective, searing barrier._

- **Effect:**
    - While you concentrate for up to 1 minute, you take **half fire damage**.
    - The next time you take fire damage, your next instance deals an extra **1d8 fire damage** and grants you **1 additional stack**.
    - **Hard Limit:** You may accumulate up to **5 stacks** from Fire Shield’s effect.
    - _Note:_ All stacks granted by Fire Shield are lost immediately if concentration is broken.
- **Art Effect:** A shimmering aura of embers and flame surrounds you, pulsing with every incoming spark.

---

### **Ember Servants**
_Call forth the living embers of the Allflame to do your bidding._

- **Effect:**
    - For each creature within 60 feet (up to a maximum of **9 creatures**, corresponding to each 5-foot space around you arranged in a circle), summon a **Tiny Fire Elemental** (see stat block below).
    - As each servant appears, it removes any stacks from that creature.
    - When an Ember Servant hits with its **Flame Spit**, it deals **1 fire damage** and applies **1 stack** to the target.
- **Art Effect:** Small, lively sparks dance around a central burst of flame that radiates outward.

---

### **Blazing Speed**
_Harness the Allflame’s urgency to outpace your foes._

- **Effect:**
    - Consume up to **5 stacks** from yourself. Based on the number consumed, you gain extra movement equal to (5/10/15/20/25/30/35) feet.
    - In addition, you gain the benefits of the **Disengage action** for that turn.
- **Art Effect:** Trails of fire form behind swift footsteps, merging into a burst of light as you dash away.

---

### **Vulnerable**
_Expose your enemy’s weakness to the burning inferno._

- **Effect:**
    - Choose one creature and consume **2 stacks** from it. That creature becomes **vulnerable to fire damage** for the next 2 turns.
    - If the target is normally resistant to fire, it instead becomes **neutral** to fire damage during this time.
- **Art Effect:** The imagery shows a creature wreathed in flickering flames, its defenses visibly crumbling under the relentless heat.

---

### **Flameshatter**
_Unleash a devastating burst of force and flame._

- **Effect:**
    - Consume **4 burn stacks** from the target.
    - The target suffers **2d8 force damage** plus **(4d6)** fire damage.  
        _(Here, the (4d6) is fixed based on consuming exactly 4 stacks.)_
- **Art Effect:** Shards of burning energy erupt in a fractal pattern, shattering opposition with explosive force.

---

### **Implode**
_Force the flame to collapse inward, devastating its target._

- **Effect:**
    - The target takes **1d10 force damage** plus an additional (1d4/2d4/3d4/4d4/5d4/6d4/7d4) fire damage that scales with the number of stacks consumed. 
- **Art Effect:** The card depicts a vortex of internal fire compressing inward, as if the flame itself were collapsing in a cataclysmic implosion.

---

### **Chaos Inferno**
_The Allflame’s chaos erupts in unpredictable forms._

- **Effect:**
    - Consume **(5/6/7)** stacks—the value chosen here is based on the number of stacks you decide to use.
    - Roll a 1d4 to determine which chaotic effect occurs:
        1. **If 1:** **Buff Up** – Up to three willing creatures are bolstered. Their attacks deal an additional **(1d4/2d4/3d4)** fire damage—scaling with the number of stacks consumed.
        2. **If 2:** **Circle of Fire** – Create a square area of flame. The area size depends on the stacks consumed: **10×10 ft** (if 5 stacks), **15×15 ft** (if 6 stacks), or **20×20 ft** (if 7 stacks). Each time a creature in the area takes damage, it gains 1 stack.
        3. **If 3:** **Conflagration Burst** – Every creature within a 20-foot radius must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take **2d6 fire damage** and gain 1 stack; on a success, they take half damage and gain no stacks.
        4. **If 4:** **Inferno’s Rebirth** – The chaotic flame returns to you. Regain a number of spent stacks equal to the consumed amount, and gain temporary hit points equal to twice that number.
- **Art Effect:** The artwork shows a dark, spriraling void of fire, which upon deciding to use the card (roll of 1d4), the card reveals a burst of flame out from its center, a chaotic inferno mimicing the promise of renewal, escaping from the card.
