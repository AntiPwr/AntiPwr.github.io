## Introduction to the Campaign  

The story begins in the **Pre-memory Archives**, a subterranean library hidden beneath the towering **Sanctan Photocenter** in Scender. Though the photonic institution above has long since replaced the Archives’ educational role with digitized data in [[Ester Slate|ESlates]], the vaults below remain a sanctuary for those who still value the weight of books, the scent of old parchment, and the tangible presence of forgotten knowledge.  

For Mellifera, a seeker of both wisdom and symbiosis, this archive is more than just a repository of facts—it is a **hive of understanding**, filled with the residual echoes of ideas long past. Her time here is spent **engrossed in literature**, particularly two books that speak to the nature of conflict and control:  

- **Dissonance II.** — A work analyzing ideological and philosophical schisms within societies, emphasizing the fracturing of belief systems and their repercussions.  
- **The Reins of Alwa** — A religiously valued story detailing the existence of a demon creature named Alwa who blocked out the sun. Her defeat to the Scepitath resulted in the existence of Aprimma, through the legs of Alwa, now known as Kyre and Luin's Point.

While **cradled in the dim lamplight of the Archives**, Mellifera's own **hallid instincts** whisper to her—her hive is growing, her role as a keeper of balance still forming. Yet, the texts before her seem to contradict each other: does control preserve, or does it corrupt? Does freedom breed harmony, or does it invite chaos? These questions linger as the wax of the flickering archive lights drip into pools of amber glow.  

But she cannot dwell forever in the silence of knowledge. A **scheduled reservation** awaits her—a **"Reservation with the Light"**—an exclusive booking at **Asath Sanctuary**, where her path will be illuminated, quite literally, by **Sanctan radiance**.  

She rises, her gelatinous form shifting, adjusting, **her swarm stirring within her**, a restless buzz barely contained beneath translucent flesh. **Knowledge has filled her, but understanding must now be sought elsewhere.**  

Her next step takes her towards the **Asath Sanctuary**, where the game truly begins.
