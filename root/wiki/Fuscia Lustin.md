_Ring Leader, Corvi's Shadow, Medan of Delta_  

_"Curiously, people resist the noble aspects of their shadow more strenuously than they hide the dark sides. To draw the skeleton out of the closet is relatively easy, but to own the gold in the shadow is terrifying."_

# Summary

**Fuscia Lustin** is the calculating and unrevealed **[[Monstra]]** leader, or **[[Medan]]**, of the **[[Chain of Delta]]**, a totalitarian regime in the **[[Toman Ecoss]]**. Known as the "Ring Leader," Fuscia maintains control over the open economic borders of **[[Delta]]** to the foreign world, inviting those seeking power, wealth, or escape. This title reflects the **[[Swirling Sea]]**, which encircles **[[Arkon]]** and is the primary path for powerful nations to enter the Chain's territory. Fuscia’s leadership of this class is marked by advanced technology, societal manipulation, and a relentless desire for control.

### The Ring Leader

Fuscia’s public persona is one of command and authority, enhanced by his carefully constructed appearance. His insecurity about his height, hidden behind height-enhancing shoes, drives him to eliminate anyone who uncovers this secret. This detail, among many others, exemplify the lengths Fuscia will go to maintain his image of dominance.

### Governance and Control

Fuscia rules Delta through a mix of drugs, psychological manipulation, and advanced technology. His **[[Bloodstream Gauntlet]]** allows him to inject substances into his body, adjusting his mental and physical states instantly. He conceals his **[[Monstra]] [[Purpose Marking]]** on his left hand with a glove, while wearing another glove on his right to hide the absence of a **[[Huma]]** Purpose Line.

Fuscia heavily influences Toma's primary means of travel, the **[[Swirling Sea]]**, which brings wealth and people to the city seasonally. His closest ally is **[[Kee]]**, the only crow in the Toman Ecoss. This crow is a direct challenge to **[[Corvi]]**, who seeks to claim her for the **[[June Preserve]]** and his own **[[Ascension]]**. Fuscia and Kee’s bond is built on greed and power, making them formidable adversaries for the **[[Sea Level Party]]**.

### MExtrema and Secret Operations

At the heart of Fuscia’s control lies **[[MExtrema]]**, a clandestine government program that distributes drugs through seemingly unaffiliated vendors. This operation serves multiple purposes: fostering addiction to control the population, identifying individuals who thrive under heavy drug use (just as Fuscia has mastered), and using them as models for societal manipulation.

The leaders of Delta's Omep regions feign opposition to Fuscia, but they are complicit in the MExtrema operation. Their flawed campaigns strengthen Fuscia’s dominance, ensuring his iron grip on Delta remains unchallenged.

#### The True Color Conflict

When the **[[Sea Level Party]]** confronts Fuscia about his deepest secrets, his facade of control and professional demeanor will break during the **[[True Color Conflict]]**. In the grand Art Hall of **[[Illid Munis]]**, Fuscia will reveal his true nature, abandoning his Fuscia-colored appearance for his true form—rich velvet green, a manifestation of pure malevolence that directly opposes **[[Corvi]]**’s innate goodness. This moment becomes the climactic battle between the Sea Level Party and Fuscia, marking a turning point in their story.

Fuscia's transformation during the True Color Conflict exposes the depth of his corruption and malevolent influence, making him the most dangerous antagonist within Delta and one of the most formidable figures in the Toman Ecoss.








Fuscia got his name from the color of a wildflower in Vokar.

Fuscia uses his left hand to retrieve Kee and his right hand to release Kee.
