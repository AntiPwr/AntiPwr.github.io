Gorosis is a Decara bacterial infection that primarily targets the brain, gradually consuming the host's mind and body. The infection is named after its association with [[Gorisain]], the god of destruction and decay, whose influence pervades the bacteria's effects. As the bacteria progress, it hollows out the host, leaving an empty core that can only be cured through a specific intervention.

#### Mechanism of Infection

Gorosis begins its insidious attack by infiltrating the brain, where it slowly takes control of the host's thoughts, emotions, and physical functions. The bacteria spread through the bloodstream, eventually dominating the entire body. The core of the host remains empty, a void that symbolizes the loss of self and the impending takeover by the Decara.

#### Dreams and Bodily Consumption

As the infection progresses, the host experiences a series of vivid and symbolic dreams that reflect their gradual decline. These dreams are often filled with imagery of decay, destruction, and the overpowering presence of Gorisain. The dreams serve as a warning to the host, indicating how close they are to losing themselves entirely to the bacteria. The final stages of infection result in the complete consumption of the host's mind and body, transforming them into a vessel for Gorisain's will.

#### Cure and Intervention

A cure for Gorosis can be found by addressing the empty core within the host. This involves a unique implementation or ritual that restores the host's sense of self and purges the Decara bacteria from their system. The exact nature of the cure is often elusive, requiring knowledge of specific rituals, substances, or interventions that can counteract the infection's effects.

Gorosis serves as a terrifying reminder of the power and reach of Gorisain, illustrating the dangers of unchecked decay and the ever-present threat of the Decara within the [[Toman Ecoss]].
