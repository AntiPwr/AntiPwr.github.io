The **Access** is the saltwater river that flows from [[Southcatch]]Bay into [[Scender|Scender Proper]], piercing through [[Contribution Band]], [[Acceptance Band]], and [[Ascension Band]] before dropping off into the underside of [[Cless]]. Here, the flow of water, pushed by the [[World Gyre|World Gyre's]] currents, falls deep into the darkness of [[Endem]].
