## The Swallow and the Smuggled Malgasta

Vankner's merchant ship is called [[The Swallow]]. As of the 12th of Atton 40 C.L., it was aprehended in Scender by Sol Unita for [[Vankner]], [[Lavinho]], and [[Bucky|Bucky's]] involvement in the release of a smuggled [[Malgasta]] onto the [[Southcatch]] boardwalk. 

See [[Sol Unita v. Laika and the Macon Collective]] for more information on the smuggling case. 

<!-- ## Background  

Vankner first found his way onto the isle of [[Babadoo Slim]] through the [[Kabelsonn Accord]], an economic treaty between the [[Tayim Trade Republic]] and the newly-formed Creatures of Hacienda (now known as [[Hacienda Band]] following their losses at the [[Battle of the Banquet]]. As part of this deal, he, among many others, were traded as children
