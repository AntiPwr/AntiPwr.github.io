**Bin**: [[Scape]]  
**Basin**: [[Sacrus]]  
**Eco**: [[Scape (TTRPG)/1 Purpose Taxonomy/Complete Taxonomy/02 Eco/01 Toman Ecoss/02 Toma/Toma]] ([[Babadoo Slim]]) of [[Toman Ecoss]]  
**Kingdom**: [[Huma]]  
**Phylum**: [[Pria]] ([[Gludestit]])
**Class**: **Hacienda Band**  

The **Hacienda Band** is the ruling class of [[New Badaba]], wielding power over the island through a blend of agricultural control, illicit trade, and a veneer of legitimacy. The Band emerged as a response to the destruction of [[Old Badaba]], where they have since established a new order based on independence from the [[Tayim Trade Republic]].

### Economy and Control

Although the Hacienda Band publicly presents itself as a group of wealthy landowners focused on the agricultural development of New Badaba, they are deeply enmeshed in illegal activities, particularly the trade in [[Primordial]]s and black-market goods. Piracy continues to be a central pillar of the Bandâ€™s economic success, though it is carefully managed to avoid open conflict with external powers.

### Culture and Governance

The Hacienda Band maintains a precarious balance between pirates and ordinary citizens. While they overtly distance themselves from the lawlessness of piracy, the Band covertly benefits from it. They have adopted aspects of the **[[Pria]]** belief system, an offshoot of **[[Gludestit]]**, which promotes spiritual connection to the natural world and rebellion against oppressive, imperialistic powers such as the Tayim Trade Republic.

### Inspiration

The structure and culture of the Hacienda Band draw inspiration from **Spanish colonial systems**, blending the **plantation** economy with the cultural and religious tensions seen in **Caribbean** and **Latin American** societies, where colonizers clashed with indigenous populations. Their secretive nature and control over illicit trade mirror **pirate cultures** and **smuggling empires**.
