# Pith Mechanic (Artificer Specialty)
_Soul Mechanic_

**Pith Mechanics** are spiritual engineers of the subconscious. They combine mystical technology with empathetic insight to explore the labyrinthine inner world (the [[Pith]]) of other creatures. These artificers bond with a partner through a special implant, entering trance-like journeys to solve surreal puzzles and uncover hidden truths. In pursuit of the legendary [[Facsimile]] – a perfect soul connection – a Pith Mechanic risks life and sanity, sharing their very life-force to guide and protect others. Their experimental practices blur the line between magic and mind, often yielding profound revelations that can change the course of destinies.

## Subclass Features

### Tool Proficiency (3rd Level)
When you adopt the Pith Mechanic specialty at 3rd level, your training grants you proficiency with either Calligrapher’s Supplies or an Herbalism Kit, reflecting your unique approach to the art of soulcraft. In addition, your deep study of the mind and spirit sharpens your perception, granting you proficiency in the Insight skill.

### Pith Mechanic Spells (3rd Level)

Beginning at 3rd level, you learn to channel your connection to the subconscious through magic. You always have certain spells prepared, and they do not count against the number of artificer spells you can prepare each day.

| Artificer Level | Spells |
|:--------------:|:------------------------------------------------------|
| 3rd            | *Heroism*, *Sanctuary*                                |
| 5th            | *Detect Thoughts*, *Calm Emotions*                    |
| 9th            | *Hypnotic Pattern*, *Intellect Fortress*              |
| 13th           | *Death Ward*, *Arcane Eye*                            |
| 17th           | *Dream*, *Legend Lore*                                |

### Soul Bond Implant (3rd Level)
Upon choosing this specialty, you begin play with a shard of Therium—a rare mineral capable of being infused with a soul. Over the course of 8 hours, you may craft this shard into a unique implant. Once created, the implant can be mystically or surgically attached to a willing creature. This bond counts against your attuned item limit, but not that of your partner, and you may only maintain one such bond at a time.

The bond is not easily broken. If you attempt to remove the implant by force, you must undergo [[Severance|self-severance]], suffering a permanent loss of [[Will|WIL]] (DM Discretion). The only safe way to end the bond is to solve Pith's puzzle, a task that can only be undertaken through ritual, insight, and accumulated trust. While bonded, you and your partner share a telepathic link. The mechanic is able to sense the implantee's emotional state and condition regardless of distance, so long as you remain on the same plane of existence. The implantee, in turn, is given influence over the environment of their mind and works in tandem with the DM to construct narrative-driven subconscious interactions, combats, puzzles, etc.

The bond also grants shared defenses. While within 60 feet of each other, your partner gains a +1 bonus to Armor Class and saving throws, and resistance to all damage. However, when your partner takes damage, you suffer the same amount as psychic damage. Through a ritual lasting 10 minutes, you may project your consciousness into your partner’s Pith—a surreal mental landscape shaped by their inner world. Solving the core issue at the heart of this landscape ends the curse, returns the implant to an inert state, and reveals a profound Truth to both participants.

### Empathic Resilience (5th Level)
At 5th level, your empathic connection deepens. While bonded, both you and your partner gain resistance to psychic damage and advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened. Once per short rest, if either of you fails a Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma saving throw, the other may use their reaction to grant a reroll, drawing on the strength of your shared bond.

### Deep Connection (9th Level)
By 9th level, your mastery of the Pith allows you to augment your bond in remarkable ways. Each day after a long rest, you may select one Hollow Augmentation for your bond:

Labyrinthine Mindscape allows you to bring a number of allies equal to your Intelligence modifier into a Pith dive, exploring the subconscious together. With Shared Senses, you may touch your partner to link your senses for up to one hour, communicating silently and, once per turn, casting spells from each other’s positions. You may use this feature a number of times per long rest equal to your Intelligence modifier.

With Hollow Vitality Exchange, as a bonus action, you may transfer up to five times your artificer level in hit points between yourself and your partner. After doing so, you must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 10 plus one for every 5 hit points transferred) or gain one level of exhaustion. This feature may be used once per long rest.

Finally, the Mnemonic Imprinter augmentation allows you, after a long rest, to swap one skill or tool proficiency with your partner until your next rest. Once per long rest, you may also reroll an Intelligence check related to memory or solving a puzzle, representing the shared mental resources of your bond.

### Commitment (15th Level)
At 15th level, your bond transcends ordinary limits. You and your bonded partner become immune to being charmed or frightened, and are always resistant to psychic damage. Allies within 30 feet of you gain advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened, inspired by the strength of your connection.

Whenever you solve a major Pith puzzle, you regain one expended spell slot of 3rd level or lower, and each participant in the dive gains inspiration or advantage on their next roll. The Dungeon Master also reveals a campaign-shaping Truth, a revelation that can alter the course of your story.

Finally, as a Life Weaver, if either you or your bonded partner drops to 0 hit points, the other may sacrifice 10 hit points to stabilize them at 1 hit point. This feature may be used once per long rest for each partner, representing the ultimate act of selfless connection.

# Integrating Hollow Resources & Therium Implants

The Pith Mechanic’s power is rooted in the mysteries of **Hollow Resources**—rare materials born from Wasting Events, where mass or belief-charged deaths leave behind potent substances. These resources fuel the class’s unique implants and infusions, defining its abilities and gameplay.

## Hollow Resources Overview
Hollow Resources are the lifeblood of technology and spirituality in Toma. They are formed when large amounts of organic or inorganic matter undergo an ideology-attuned death event. The souls once contained in that matter are severed, leaving behind concentrated deposits imbued with spiritual energy and belief. Each resource’s nature depends on the origin material and its Kingdom—a belief-aligned category of life in the world’s cosmology. These materials are extraordinarily powerful and coveted; entire civilizations have risen and fallen over their control. For a Pith Mechanic, Hollow Resources present an opportunity to craft unique devices and implants that channel their inherent magical properties.

**Key Hollow Resources:**
- **Therium** (Decara): Conducts spiritual energy and stores belief; the signature implant material for the Pith Mechanic. <!--Formed in the feeding pits of Dar after catastrophic events, Therium contains the echo of a soul’s will, making it uniquely suited to infuse with belief and consciousness.-->
- **Photometal** (Bluma): Captures thoughts and beliefs via light; used for slates and visors that store illusions or memories.
- **Grame** (Decara): Consumes belief and invokes decay; used for lures, vials, and traps that sap resolve or attract decay-aligned creatures.
- **Primma/Aprima** (Celia): Radiate rebirth energy; beads and talismans promote healing, growth, or miraculous effects.
- **Dai & Iko Stones** (Ferra): Paired stones that resonate as untraceable communicators or trackers, symbolizing the eternal chase between predator and prey.

## Therium – The Core Implant Material
Therium is a dark, dense Hollow Metal of immense versatility and the cornerstone of the Pith Mechanic’s features. <!--It is exceptionally rare, formed in the feeding pits of Dar as departing souls infuse nearby rock. The result is Therium ore—composed of a soul’s spiritual print and anima bound with trace minerals. Once implanted and attuned, Therium behaves almost like a living part of the host, establishing its own belief sphere and granting extraordinary abilities fueled by the implant. The sphere of belief within Therium can be “fed” with the Mechanic’s or host’s thoughts and emotions, effectively programming the implant with desired traits or powers. -->

<!--**Why Therium?** Its ability to conduct and store spiritual energy is unparalleled. Once infused with a person’s belief or intent, it can grow in power and even develop quasi-sentience. In game terms, this could manifest as the implant “evolving” new features as the character gains levels or accomplishes significant feats. Its rarity also balances its power—obtaining a Therium core is a grand quest in itself, justified by its role as the class’s core feature. Only the most significant Wasting Events yield Therium, and it’s typically found in dangerous, high-altitude Thresholds. This explains why an adventuring Pith Mechanic might be one of the few to possess such a piece.-->

**Reusable but with a Cost:** Unlike most other resources, a Therium implant isn’t consumed on use—it’s a permanent augmentation. However, changing who it’s bonded to is non-trivial. The connection between the Therium and the host’s soul runs deep. If the Mechanic ever needs to remove or transfer the implant, it requires Self-Severance—a dramatic ritual that may temporarily weaken the host or have other side effects as a portion of their life-force is detached. This cost ensures that the choice of who receives the Therium implant is meaningful and not made lightly.

## Inspiration

The Pith Mechanic subclass is heavily inspired by the poem "Simile of Souls," which explores the nature of connection, empathy, and the boundaries between individual minds. You can read the poem on the <a href="../poetry.html#Simile-of-Souls" target="_blank">poetry.html</a> page. Many of the class’s core themes—shared experience, the search for understanding, and the risks of deep connection—are drawn directly from the ideas and imagery found in this work.
