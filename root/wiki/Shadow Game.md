Shadow Game manifests as a small living animal—such as the [[Shade Squirrel]]—formed entirely of coalescing shadows. Its fluid form, marked by two glowing red eyes that radiate an inner inferno, embodies the capricious nature of darkness. Often discovered in forgotten ruins or summoned by those who dare to harness forbidden power, this creature offers both potent benefits and dire risks.

## Activation & Consumption:
When a player consumes a small, live shadow Chiment, the following effects occur simultaneously:

### Will Reduction & Darkvision Boost:
**Cost:** The player's [[Will]] (WIL) transformed by 5 points per live game consumed.
**Benefit:** The player's darkvision increases by 5 feet per live game consumed.
**Duration:** The bonus darkvision lasts for a number of hours equal to the number of live game consumed.

### Light Exposure Penalty:

While under the effects conferred by Shadow Game, any exposure to a light source triggers a reaction from the Shade Will—an aspect of the Shadow manifestation of your Will.

**Effect:** The player takes immediate damage equal to their current Shade Will value. Following this, the Shade Will is removed and replaced by their original Will value.
**Note:** This soul-deep damage, inherent to the Shade Will manifestation, cannot be resisted or mitigated by conventional means.
