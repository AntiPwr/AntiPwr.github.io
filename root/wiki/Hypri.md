Hypri is a remarkable city-state built upon and within a series of natural stone spires that rise dramatically from the vast grasslands of South [[Usaka]]. Home to approximately 230,000 permanent residents and a fluctuating population of over 1 million traders, diplomats, and visitors, Hypri's architectural marvel comes not just from its striking silhouette against the sky but from its apparent defiance of natural laws. The gravitational fields surrounding its spires—believed locally to emanate from special ore within the stone—create a unique environment where buildings can be constructed at seemingly impossible angles, and single-person airships navigate between towering structures along invisible currents.

As the seat of the [[Hypri Highcourt]] and home to the enigmatic [[Ahdom Few]], Hypri serves as both cultural melting pot and power nexus in western Usaka, with influence extending across the continent and beyond.

## Geography and Structure

### The Spires

Hypri's defining feature is its cluster of seventeen major spires—natural stone formations that rise between 300 and 800 meters above the surrounding plains. These dramatic geological formations were thrust upward during what locals call the "Great Natura's Rise," but what scholars outside Hypri identify as a powerful tectonic events thousands of years ago. The spires are composed primarily of ancient metamorphic rock with unique mineral deposits at their cores.

The spires serve different functions within Hypri society:

- **Grand Spire** – The tallest formation and administrative center, housing the [[Hypri Highcourt]]
- **Sister Spires** – Three adjacent formations converted into the personal domains of the [[Ahdom Few]]
- **Trade Spires** – Five structures dedicated to commerce, featuring platforms for airship docking
- **Dwelling Spires** – Seven formations where most of the permanent population resides
- **Splint** – The most heavily guarded spire, featuring a significant crack through its center

<div class="feathermark">
    <p class="feathermark-attribution">Corvi's Feathermark</p>
    <p>Oh, they'll tell you the spires rose from the earth in some grand, divine spectacle—the birth pangs of creation, a miracle of geological whimsy! Such delightful propaganda! The stones speak different truths to those who know how to listen.</p>
    <p>These aren't natural formations at all, but the calcified remains of something that once stretched between worlds. Look closely at the striations in the rock face next time you visit—they don't follow geological patterns; they pulse with directionality, like massive fossilized arteries. The Dwellers know this truth in their bones, which is precisely why they worship and fear the spires in equal measure.</p>
    <p>And that crack in the Splint? Not a crack at all, but a mouth slowly working its way open again after millennia. The guards aren't protecting something; they're containing it.</p>
</div>

### Splint and the Gravity Ore

At the heart of Hypri's mysteries lies the Splint, a spire bisected by a dramatic crack that runs from its peak to approximately halfway down its shaft. Within this fissure lies what the Hypri Highcourt calls "gravity ore"—a substance that, according to local belief, generates the unusual gravitational fields that make Hypri's architecture and transportation systems possible.

The Splint is the most heavily guarded area in Hypri. Visitors report that those who attempt unauthorized access appear to be "pulled" into the fissure by an unseen force, only to be escorted out later with no memory of what they witnessed inside. Official doctrine states that the ore "resolves issues" with individuals by temporarily removing them from normal space-time.

Scientific observers from [[Sol Unita]] and the [[Branches of Concordia]] have proposed alternative explanations for Hypri's unusual physical properties, suggesting advanced technology or natural phenomena rather than the "belief-sustained gravity" claimed by Hypri authorities.

### Sibannac's Carpet

Surrounding Hypri on all sides is a vast expanse of tall grass known as Sibannac's Carpet—a living entity controlled by the single soul of [[Sibannac]], one of many deities worshipped in Hypri. This carnivorous grass creates a natural defense system around the city:

- The grass grows around individuals' souls, blocking their vision while giving the impression they haven't moved far
- The environment disorients travelers without proper guides, causing them to walk in circles until exhaustion
- Those who fall asleep or die in the grass are consumed by it

A network of carefully maintained paths allows safe travel through Sibannac's Carpet, but these routes are closely guarded and frequently changed to prevent hostile forces from mapping them.

## Governance and the Ahdom Few

Hypri is ruled by the [[Hypri Highcourt]], a governing body presided over by the three serpent sisters collectively known as the [[Ahdom Few]]:

- **[[Ximena Lathen]]** – The Sea Trielder and Drakemaster of [[Lopali]], who publicly appears as Lady Athen to conceal her Concordian lineage. She rules the water-focused aspects of Hypri governance and maintains the isolated [[Imaan Plane]] of [[Heshiu]].

- **[[Jarma Konich]]** – The Land Trielder and Drakemaster of [[Kautiger]], who has formed a controversial partnership with [[Fuscia Lustin]] of the [[Chain of Delta]], creating a lucrative drug trade. She oversees territorial matters and resource management.

- **[[Siela Qane]]** – The Sky Trielder and Drakemaster of [[Qa'ura]], a devoted follower of [[Asceptim]] who works as a religious architect. She currently oversees the construction of [[Palas]], an aerial [[Imaan Plane]] dedicated to [[Asath]].

<div class="feathermark">
    <p class="feathermark-attribution">Corvi's Feathermark</p>
    <p>The vastness of their deception is matched only by the depth of their ancestral wounds. Each sister carries a fragment of memory from the sundering of Hidraal—a psychic inheritance that drives them toward reunification while simultaneously compelling them to remain separate.</p>
    <p>Their public personas—carefully constructed masks that hide their true nature—serve as both protection and prison. Ximena's rejection of her Concordian lineage isn't merely political; it's existential. The very name "Leredith" would cause molecular disruption in the carefully maintained belief field that suspends Heshiu between realities.</p>
    <p>The sisters represent the three primal forces of creation: sea, land, and sky. But there should be four, shouldn't there? Where is the representative of fire, of transformation? Look to the Splint, to what pulses within that "crack," and perhaps you'll understand why they guard it so ferociously.</p>
    <p>They are not rulers. They are caretakers of something far older than themselves, something that dreams beneath Hypri, something that must never fully awaken.</p>
</div>

Each Trielder maintains authority over one of the major drakes—the [[Spawn of Hidraal]]—giving them control over powerful primordial entities. This connection to the ancient hydra [[Hidraal]] forms the spiritual and historical foundation of their rule, though this connection is not widely understood among the general population.

The Highcourt's daily operations are managed by a council of elected representatives from each spire, but final authority on all matters rests with the Ahdom Few.

## Transportation and Technology

### Gravity Manipulation

The most distinctive feature of Hypri's infrastructure is its relationship with gravity. Throughout the city, gravitational fields behave unpredictably by conventional physics. Buildings can be constructed sideways or even upside-down, with residents able to walk normally on all surfaces due to localized gravitational orientation.

This phenomenon is attributed to the gravity ore within the Splint, though the exact nature of this material is closely guarded. What makes Hypri's gravity manipulation unique is that it appears to be sustained by collective belief rather than conventional technology or natural forces. Outsiders often find that their own perception of gravity begins to align with local expectations after extended stays in the city.

### Single-Person Airships

Transportation between spires is primarily accomplished via single-person airships—lightweight, maneuverable vessels that follow invisible currents of altered gravity. These vessels require minimal propulsion, instead relying on the rider's understanding of Hypri's unique aerial pathways.

The airships typically feature:
- A small gondola for the pilot
- Minimal sail or propulsion systems
- Navigation devices attuned to Hypri's gravitational fields
- Highly personalized designs reflecting the owner's status and taste

Learning to pilot these vessels is considered a rite of passage for Hypri natives, with children beginning training around age seven. Visitors can hire pilots or attempt to navigate themselves after obtaining proper certification from the Highcourt.

### Wind Harvesting and the Vent System

Perhaps Hypri's most impressive engineering feat after its gravity manipulation is its elaborate wind harvesting infrastructure. Rather than traditional sewage systems, Hypri employs an extensive network of vents that capture the powerful air currents of the [[World Gyre]] as they flow across [[Usaka]].

These massive intake vents are positioned strategically around the outer edges of the spires, particularly at elevations where gyre winds are strongest. The system serves multiple critical functions:

- **Power Generation** – Wind turbines within the vent network provide approximately 70% of Hypri's energy needs
- **Waste Removal** – Pressurized air channels waste from dwellings through the hollow cores of the spires and out exhaust vents near the base
- **Climate Control** – Regulated airflow provides natural cooling throughout warmer months and circulates heated air during colder periods
- **Pressurization** – Maintains stable atmospheric pressure within enclosed spaces despite the city's varying elevations

The vent system's engineering brilliance lies in its exploitation of the natural pressure differentials created by the spires' heights and the World Gyre's consistent flow patterns. The result is a nearly self-sustaining system that requires minimal external energy input.

However, this system does create significant waste accumulation zones at the bases of the spires, particularly in areas where air currents deposit solid waste. While [[Sibannac]]'s carpet consumes much of this organic matter, large areas of non-degradable waste have formed over centuries, creating a stark contrast between the magnificent airborne city and its less pristine foundations.

### Wind Highways and Inter-Spire Travel

Hypri is connected to other spire cities across [[Usaka]] through an ingenious system of "wind highways"—artificially maintained air corridors that neutralize or redirect the [[World Gyre]]'s natural currents. These highways allow airship travel against the otherwise prohibitive clockwise flow that dominates the [[Current Line]].

Each highway is maintained by a series of massive wind manipulation towers that create counter-currents and zones of calm, allowing pilots to navigate between destinations without fighting the gyre's natural force. The highways connect Hypri to the three other major spire cities of Usaka:

- **[[Ventari]]** – The northern central spire city, known for its scholarly institutions
- **[[Aeradyme]]** – The northwestern spire complex, famous for its artistic communities
- **[[Zephyra]]** – The western outpost city and gateway to [[Theologia]]

A particularly notable wind highway extends from Zephyra to the continent of [[Theologia]], enabling one-way travel to this narrow western landmass. However, no return highway exists due to the strength of opposing gyre currents, requiring travelers to take sea passage to [[Tayim]] to secure airship transport back to Hypri.

These wind highways are maintained through cooperative agreements between the spire cities and represent one of the region's most valuable pieces of shared infrastructure. The responsibility for their upkeep falls primarily to the [[Hypri Highcourt]], with [[Siela Qane]] overseeing most operations due to her expertise in aerial pressurization magic.

### Pressurization Magic and Outlawed Practices

Wind magic, more formally known as pressurization magic, is deeply ingrained in Hypri's culture and technological development. Practitioners manipulate air pressure to create effects ranging from small bursts of controlled wind to massive atmospheric shifts capable of altering local weather patterns.

The three members of the [[Ahdom Few]] are considered the foremost masters of pressurization magic, each specializing in a different form:

- **[[Jarma Konich]]** – Earth pressurization, manipulating solid matter through compression and decompression
- **[[Siela Qane]]** – Air pressurization, controlling gaseous elements and atmospheric conditions
- **[[Ximena Lathen]]** – Water pressurization, influencing liquid states and hydrodynamics

While pressurization magic is celebrated and widely practiced, gravity magic is strictly prohibited within Hypri. Despite this ban—or perhaps because of it—underground cults focused on gravity manipulation have emerged among younger citizens. These groups, collectively known as the [[Falling Stone Covenant]], practice forbidden techniques that directly interact with the gravity ore inside the spires.

The Hypri Highcourt maintains that tampering with the gravity stones could destabilize the entire city, potentially causing catastrophic collapse of the spire ecosystem. This conservative stance has created tension with youth movements that see gravity magic as their birthright and the next frontier in Hypri's magical development.

## Cultural Diversity and Belief Systems

Hypri is one of the most culturally diverse cities in [[Usaka]], hosting adherents of numerous religious and philosophical traditions. The native population, known as [[Dweller]]s, maintains the oldest belief systems centered around the spires themselves and [[Sibannac]].

Major belief systems include:

- **Spire Veneration** – Native Dweller practice focusing on the spiritual significance of the spires
- **Sibannac Offerings** – Ceremonial practice of casting deceased bodies from the spires as offerings to the grass deity
- **[[Gludestit]]** – Ancient worship of [[Hidraal]] maintained by some traditionalists
- **[[Asceptim]]** – Imported faith gaining popularity under [[Siela Qane]]'s influence
- **Various Nesa Devotions** – Worship of different deity-like beings

The term "Nesa" itself has Usakan origins, referring to powerful entities believed to exist beyond mortal understanding. Hypri scholars maintain extensive records of Nesa manifestations throughout history, making the city an important center for theological study.

<div class="feathermark">
    <p class="feathermark-attribution">Corvi's Feathermark</p>
    <p>I have watched children in Hypri learn to navigate the currents between spires—tiny bodies suspended in fragile crafts, caught between terror and exhilaration. They do not understand that their successful flights depend not on their skill but on their innocence, on their unquestioning acceptance of impossibility.</p>
    <p>As they age, their vessels become more elaborate, compensating for the growing doubt in their minds. By adulthood, the ships require complex mechanisms and calculations to achieve what once came naturally. The oldest pilots carry notebooks filled with arcane formulas that do nothing but quiet their disbelieving minds.</p>
    <p>The children see what the adults have forgotten—the air between spires is alive with whispers from an older world. Listen carefully as you drift between towers: the sound isn't wind but breath, ancient and patient, feeding on your conviction that you won't fall.</p>
</div>

## Economy and Resources

### The Soil Inn

The economic center of Hypri is a massive structure known as the Soil Inn—a multilevel marketplace carved into and built around one of the smaller spires. Named for a popular local poem that celebrates the fertile ground of Usaka, the Soil Inn hosts hundreds of merchants trading in goods from across Toma.

Major exports from Hypri include:

- **Cultivated Clay** – Processed by followers of [[Kautiger]] for pottery and construction
- **[[Moluk]]** – A food substance made from Kautiger's clay that doubles as a mild intoxicant
- **Gravitationally-Altered Materials** – Unique substances processed in the unusual conditions near the Splint
- **Cartographic Services** – Highly detailed maps of Usaka created by explorers who navigate Sibannac's Carpet

### Relationship with the Chain of Delta

Hypri maintains complex diplomatic and trade relationships with the [[Chain of Delta]], particularly through [[Jarma Konich]]'s partnership with [[Fuscia Lustin]]. This arrangement has led to Hypri becoming a significant production center for substances exported to the Chain, particularly [[Moluk]], which has gained popularity as an inexpensive recreational drug.

This economic relationship has created tension with [[Siela Qane]]'s religious aspirations and [[Ximena Lathen]]'s isolationist tendencies, representing the internal conflicts among the Ahdom Few.

## Historical Connections

### Hidraal and the Spawn

Though not commonly known among average citizens, Hypri's ruling class maintains knowledge of the city's connection to [[Hidraal]], the ancient three-headed hydra who once dominated the region through the [[Gludestit]] belief system. After Hidraal's beheading, her three heads became the primordial serpents now known as the [[Spawn of Hidraal]]:

- [[Lopali]] – The Serpent Ray, a Ferra-Water Natura hybrid controlled by Ximena Lathen
- [[Kautiger]] – The Oedipwyrm, a multi-headed Ground Natura-Celia hybrid controlled by Jarma Konich
- [[Qa'ura]] – The Amphiptere serpent with crystalline features controlled by Siela Qane

A fourth entity, [[Hathakrik]], represents Hidraal's regrown body but resides in the separate realm of [[Dar]] rather than Toma.

The Ahdom Few's true ambition—kept secret from all but their closest confidants—is the eventual reunification of these serpents to restore [[Gludestit]] and liberate primordials from [[Hoard Sickness]], though each sister has different visions of how this should be accomplished.
