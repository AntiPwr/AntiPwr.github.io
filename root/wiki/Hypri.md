Hypri is a high-altitude [[Order|order]] under the rule of the [[Hypri Highcourt]], perched atop the largest of over a hundred spires that rise dramatically from the vast grasslands of South [[Usaka]]. Geographically, Hypri is located in the Middle-East region of South Usaka, just northeast of the [[Coast of Bu]]. Across the waters from the Coast of Bu lies the Island of [[Babadoo Slim]]. The city is carved into and grown upon the colossal stone formation known as Vespir, which soars impossibly high above a sea of thick, churning clouds. Its rugged, ancient, golden-beige stonework is weathered by time and sun, yet teems with life and civilization. Entire cities cling to its craggy surface, jutting out at impossible angles and spiraling upward in a breathtakingly precarious ascent, as if the spire itself has grown these settlements like barnacles on a sea pillar.

The livable regions of Hypri spiral counterclockwise up the spire. From a human perspective, walking up the city means moving diagonally leftward along the main ascending avenue. Along this spiral path are houses, shops, government buildings, bazaars, parks, alcoves, and more, each tier blending into the next as the city transitions from the bustling Trade Belt to the rarified Summit Zone.

Pockets of greenery — trees, vines, and hanging gardens — sprout from terraces and crevices, softening the starkness of the stone with vibrant splashes of green. Winding around the spire are ethereal tendrils of mist and magical energy, curling like serpents and weaving pathways and highways that pulse and shimmer in the sunlight, alive with motion and magic. Floating glass spheres — miniature greenhouses enclosing thriving ecosystems — orbit the spire at various heights, each a crystalline world adrift, housing tiny forests, groves, and meadows suspended in midair.

Hypri’s wind tunnel system is one of its defining features. These are naturally occurring and magically enhanced currents that serve as transportation corridors and energy distribution networks. Wind tunnels are used by airships, trade vessels, and courier winds, and also connect interior residential and industrial zones, acting like pneumatic boulevards and climate regulators. The wind tunnels are vital veins of the city, channeling both people and resources through the vertical metropolis.

Among these misty currents and glass orbs, sleek flying ships glide gracefully, their organic shapes skimming along invisible highways created by swirling currents. Some are nimble and birdlike, darting between levels, while others are majestic sovereign ships, trailing banners and bearing regal insignias. The overall feeling is one of serene majesty — a civilization that has mastered the verticality of nature, crafting a metropolis in perfect symbiosis with wind, gravity, and life. Above it all, the sky stretches wide and soft, painted in dreamy blues and whites, the light diffused through layers of mist and vapor, as if the very heavens cradle this wondrous place.

Home to approximately 230,000 permanent residents and a fluctuating population of over 1 million traders, diplomats, and visitors, Hypri's architectural marvel comes not just from its striking silhouette against the sky but from its apparent defiance of natural laws. The gravitational fields surrounding the spire—believed locally to emanate from special ore within the stone—create a unique environment where buildings can be constructed at seemingly impossible angles, and single-person airships navigate around the towering structure along invisible currents.

## Geography and Structure

### Vespir

The city-state is built upon and within a single colossal formation that dominates the landscape, known as Vespir. This massive geological anomaly was thrust upward during what locals call the "Great Natura's Rise," but what scholars outside Hypri identify as a powerful tectonic event thousands of years ago. Vespir is composed primarily of ancient metamorphic rock with unique mineral deposits at its core. Its surface is rugged and jagged, yet alive with civilization — entire districts and cities are carved into its crags, spiraling upward in a breathtaking ascent.

The spiral orientation of Hypri’s livable regions means that as one ascends, they follow a counterclockwise path, with the main avenue winding leftward and upward. This spiral is lined with a socioeconomic gradient: lower tiers house bustling markets and working-class neighborhoods, while higher tiers transition to administrative, governmental, and elite residential zones, culminating in the Summit Zone and the domains of the Ahdom Few.

The spire is subdivided into distinct zones that serve different functions within Hypri society:

- **Summit Zone** (8,100-8,600m/26,600-28,200ft) – The uppermost inhabitable section housing the [[Hypri Highcourt]] and administrative centers
- **Sister Domains** (7,800-8,100m/25,600-26,600ft) – Three adjacent sections converted into the personal domains of the [[Ahdom Few]]
- **Trade Belt** (7,200-7,800m/23,600-25,600ft) – A wide band circling the spire dedicated to commerce, featuring platforms for airship docking and the famous Soil Inn. The Trade Belt is Hypri’s central trade hub, wrapping around the spire and home to the Splint, the gravity-cracked heart of Vespir. It is a chaotic yet structured space buzzing with trade, air traffic, and magical logistics. The Soil Inn, the most famous inn within the Trade Belt, serves traders, dignitaries, travelers, and locals. Named after a beloved local poem connected to [[Sibannac]], it functions as both a cultural center and commercial hotspot.
- **Dwelling Tiers** (7,000-7,200m/23,000-23,600ft) – Multiple ring-like sections where most of the permanent population resides
- **The Splint Region** (6,800-7,300m/22,300-24,000ft) – A heavily guarded area containing the Splint, a significant crack that runs vertically through a section of the spire

Pockets of greenery — trees, vines, and hanging gardens — sprout from terraces and crevices, softening the starkness of the stone with vibrant splashes of green. Floating glass spheres — miniature greenhouses enclosing thriving ecosystems — orbit the spire at various heights, each a crystalline world adrift, housing tiny forests, groves, and meadows suspended in midair.

The flora of Hypri includes gravitationally adapted plants and cliff-dwelling vegetation: bioluminescent spores, climbing reeds, and thin-threaded vines that pulse with Anim, clinging to stone and glass alike. These plants thrive in the altered gravity and wind-swept microclimates, creating a tapestry of color and light along the spiral path.

**Hypri’s unique ecosystem supports a range of native flying fauna:**
- Small flying mammals that nest among the roots, vines, and cracks of Vespir, gliding between alcoves and feeding on windborne seeds and insects.
- Burrowing or clinging creatures that make their homes in the inner walls and crevices of the stone, adapted to the shifting gravity and pressure.
- A unique species of gravitational raptor-like bird, known for using Hypri’s altered gravity fields to glide in tight, swift spirals around the spire. These birds are culturally significant to Dwellers, symbolizing elegance and mastery, and are often depicted in Hypri art and heraldry.

Winding around the spire are ethereal tendrils of mist and magical energy, curling like serpents and weaving pathways and highways that pulse and shimmer in the sunlight, alive with motion and magic. The wind tunnel system—naturally occurring and magically enhanced—serves as the city’s arteries. These tunnels are used by airships, trade vessels, and couriers, and also connect interior residential and industrial zones, acting as pneumatic boulevards and climate regulators. Wind tunnels are essential for both transportation and energy distribution, making them vital to Hypri’s infrastructure and daily life.

### Atmospheric Retention and the Gravity Field

One of Hypri's most remarkable features is its habitable environment at elevations that would normally be uninhabitable due to thin atmosphere. At heights between 7,000 to 8,600 meters (23,000 to 28,200 feet), oxygen levels in Earth-like conditions would be insufficient to support human life, yet Hypri's residents breathe freely without assistance.

This paradox is explained by the spire's unique gravitational properties, centered on the mystical [[Ankelore]] found within the Splint. The localized gravity field not only allows for unusual architectural constructions but also:

- Creates a compressed atmospheric bubble around the spire that maintains Earth-like air pressure
- Generates weather patterns unique to the spire, including localized cloud formations and precipitation
- Establishes distinct microclimates at different elevations and facings around the spire's circumference

The precise mechanisms of these gravitational anomalies remain contentious among outside scholars. While Hypri authorities attribute them to the natural properties of the Ankelore enhanced by collective belief, scientists from [[Sol Unita]] and the [[Branches of Concordia]] propose theories involving advanced ancient technology or naturally occurring magical resonance fields.

### The Splint and Ankelore

At the heart of Hypri's mysteries lies the Splint, a dramatic crack that runs from near the summit to approximately halfway down Vespir's shaft. Within this fissure lies what the Hypri Highcourt calls "Ankelore"—a [[Hollow Resource]] created through the death-process of the [[Natura]] [[Kingdom]]. This rare ore is responsible for generating the unusual gravitational fields that make Hypri's architecture, transportation systems, and atmospheric retention possible.

Ankelore is encased in a brittle mantle of pale stone known as Gravemarrow—a semi-permeable mineral that absorbs [[Anim]] (belief energy) and prevents its escape. What makes Ankelore unique among resources is that its gravitational effect cannot be predicted by mass alone; instead, the force it exerts depends on how much Anim it has absorbed, making it the only known material whose gravitational field is partially defined by conviction.

The Splint and its contained Ankelore are the most heavily guarded areas in Hypri. Visitors report that those who attempt unauthorized access appear to be "pulled" into the fissure by an unseen force, only to be escorted out later with no memory of what they witnessed inside. Official doctrine states that the Ankelore "resolves issues" with individuals by temporarily removing them from normal space-time.

The [[Ahdom Few]] claim to monitor the Ankelore's density readings daily, though some underground cults believe they actually worship it rather than safeguard it. Cultural fear exists around the possibility of over-saturation—a hypothetical event where Anim exceeds containment limits, potentially resulting in the Splint collapsing into what scholars call a "Thought Well."

### Sibannac's Carpet

Surrounding Hypri on all sides is a vast expanse of tall grass known as Sibannac's Carpet—a living entity controlled by the single soul of [[Sibannac]], one of many deities worshipped in Hypri. This carnivorous grass creates a natural defense system around the city:

- The grass grows around individuals' souls, blocking their vision while giving the impression they haven't moved far
- The environment disorients travelers without proper guides, causing them to walk in circles until exhaustion
- Those who fall asleep or die in the grass are consumed by it

A network of carefully maintained paths allows safe travel through Sibannac's Carpet, but these routes are closely guarded and frequently changed to prevent hostile forces from mapping them.

## Grow Zones and Ecological Systems

### Atmospheric Gardens

A crucial element of Hypri's self-sustainability is its extensive network of atmospheric gardens—specialized grow zones distributed throughout the spire that serve both practical and aesthetic functions. These gardens are designed to maintain oxygen levels, provide fresh food, and create living spaces that connect residents to nature despite their extreme elevation.

The three primary types of atmospheric gardens found throughout Hypri include:

#### Windflow Terraces

These open-air terraces utilize the natural airflow around the spire to cultivate specialized plants that thrive in high-altitude conditions. Wind-capturing surfaces direct air currents through dense plantings of:

- **Skyroot Ferns** – Native plants with deep anchoring systems and broad leaves that efficiently capture carbon dioxide
- **Airbloom Mosses** – Fast-growing mosses that release high volumes of oxygen when stimulated by wind
- **Drift Orchids** – Flowering plants that help filter particulates from the air while providing visual beauty

The design of these terraces incorporates aerodynamic principles to create positive pressure zones that help retain atmospheric moisture and stability. Most residential sections of Hypri include access to at least one windflow terrace, which serves as both a community gathering space and an essential component of the city's air quality management system.

#### Greenhouse Globes

Perhaps the most visually striking elements of Hypri's architecture are its greenhouse globes—spherical glass structures of varying sizes that protrude from the spire at different elevations. These pressurized environments serve as:

- Controlled cultivation spaces for food crops that couldn't survive in open-air conditions
- Botanical research facilities where new plant varieties are developed
- Cultural spaces where residents can experience environments mimicking different regions of Toma

The largest greenhouse globe, known as the "Sun Sphere," is located near the Summit Zone and spans 60 meters (197 feet) in diameter. It houses rare specimens from across the continent and serves as both a conservation center and a place of meditation for the [[Ahdom Few]].

The glass used in these structures is produced using sand exposed to the unique gravitational conditions near the Splint, resulting in a material with exceptional clarity and strength. The spherical design maximizes structural integrity while creating optimal light distribution for plant growth.

#### Embedded Root Networks

The most technically complex of Hypri's grow zones are the Embedded Root Networks—living systems integrated directly into the spire's interior. These networks consist of:

- Specialized fungi and plants grown within hollowed sections of the rock
- Hydroponic channels that distribute water and nutrients throughout the system
- Bioluminescent organisms that provide natural lighting in interior spaces

These root networks serve multiple functions beyond oxygen production:
- Natural air filtration and humidity regulation
- Structural reinforcement for interior caverns and passages
- Waste processing through mycological decomposition
- Emotional well-being for residents through connection to living systems

The development and maintenance of these networks is overseen by a specialized guild of cultivators who combine botanical knowledge with pressurization magic to sustain optimal growing conditions.

### Wind Automation Systems

Hypri's engineers have developed sophisticated systems that harness the constant wind currents around the spire to power automated processes throughout the city. The most notable application is in agricultural production, where wind automation has revolutionized farming practices at high elevations.

#### Cyclone Harvesting

In traditional farming, harvest season requires significant labor for collecting and transporting crops. Hypri's cyclone harvesting system eliminates much of this work through ingenious use of controlled air currents:

1. Cultivation platforms are designed with funnel-shaped collection zones beneath crops
2. When fruits or vegetables naturally ripen and fall, or when plants are harvested, the produce drops into these collection zones
3. Directed wind currents then transport the harvested items through a network of pneumatic tubes
4. Sorting stations use differential air pressure to separate items by size, weight, and density
5. The sorted produce is delivered directly to processing facilities or distribution centers

This system reduces harvest labor by approximately 70% while minimizing bruising and damage to delicate crops. The entire process relies entirely on natural wind currents enhanced through pressurization magic, requiring no additional energy input.

#### Atmospheric Seeding

Another application of wind automation is the atmospheric seeding system, which maintains Hypri's airborne gardens:

- Specialized towers release timed bursts of seeds, spores, and beneficial microorganisms
- Wind currents distribute these materials to targeted growing areas around the spire
- Moisture-activated adhesives ensure the biological materials attach to appropriate surfaces
- Regular maintenance cycles keep the ecosystem balanced and self-renewing

This system creates the living tapestry of vegetation that adorns Hypri's exterior, with different species blossoming at different elevations and seasons to create year-round visual interest and ecological support.

#### Cultural Significance of Air Plants

Air plants hold special cultural significance in Hypri society, symbolizing the city's unique relationship with the sky and wind. The most revered varieties include:

- **Windflowers** – Delicate blooms that never touch soil, absorbing all nutrients from the air
- **Drift Moss** – Buoyant clusters that float in stable air currents around the spire
- **Sky Orchids** – Rare flowering plants that attach to the highest points of structures

Citizens often cultivate personal collections of these plants in their homes, with skilled growers achieving considerable social status. The annual Windbloom Festival celebrates these plants with displays, competitions, and the ceremonial release of propagating spores from the Summit Zone.

Religious ceremonies often incorporate air plants, particularly those honoring [[Siela Qane]] and her connection to [[Qa'ura]]. Offerings of specially cultivated specimens are considered particularly auspicious during important life transitions.

## Governance and the Ahdom Few

Hypri is ruled by the [[Hypri Highcourt]], a governing body presided over by the three serpent sisters collectively known as the [[Ahdom Few]]:

- **[[Ximena Lathen|Lady Athen]]** – The Sea Trielder and Drakemaster of [[Lopali]].

- **[[Jarma Konich]]** – The Land Trielder and Drakemaster of [[Kautiger]].  
  _Jarma's reputation among the native Dwellers is notably low, with many suspecting her of self-serving motives and resenting her controversial role in the Moluk trade. This tension is reflected in both social discourse and policy, fueling a cycle of distrust and exclusion._

- **[[Siela Qane]]** – The Sky Trielder and Drakemaster of [[Qa'ura]].

Each Trielder maintains authority over one of the major drakes—the [[Spawn of Hidraal]]—giving them control over powerful primordial entities. This connection to the ancient hydra [[Hidraal]] forms the spiritual and historical foundation of their rule, though this connection is not widely understood among the general population.

The Highcourt's daily operations are managed by a council of elected representatives from each spire, but final authority on all matters rests with the Ahdom Few.

## Transportation and Technology

### Gravity Manipulation

The most distinctive feature of Hypri's infrastructure is its relationship with gravity. Throughout the city, gravitational fields behave unpredictably by conventional physics. Buildings can be constructed sideways or even upside-down, with residents able to walk normally on all surfaces due to localized gravitational orientation.

This phenomenon is attributed to the ore within the Splint, though the exact nature of this material is closely guarded. What makes Hypri's gravity manipulation unique is that it appears to be sustained by collective belief rather than conventional technology or natural forces. Outsiders often find that their own perception of gravity begins to align with local expectations after extended stays in the city.

### Single-Person Airships

Transportation between spires is primarily accomplished via single-person airships—lightweight, maneuverable vessels that follow invisible currents of altered gravity. These vessels require minimal propulsion, instead relying on the rider's understanding of Hypri's unique aerial pathways.

The airships typically feature:
- A small gondola for the pilot
- Minimal sail or propulsion systems
- Navigation devices attuned to Hypri's gravitational fields
- Highly personalized designs reflecting the owner's status and taste.

Learning to pilot these vessels is considered a rite of passage for Hypri natives, with children beginning training around age seven. Visitors can hire pilots or attempt to navigate themselves after obtaining proper certification from the Highcourt.

### Wind Harvesting and the Vent System

Perhaps Hypri's most impressive engineering feat after its gravity manipulation is its elaborate wind harvesting infrastructure. Rather than traditional sewage systems, Hypri employs an extensive network of vents that capture the powerful air currents of the [[World Gyre]] as they flow across [[Usaka]].

These massive intake vents are positioned strategically around the outer circumference of the spire, particularly at elevations where gyre winds are strongest. The system serves multiple critical functions:

- **Power Generation** – Wind turbines within the vent network provide approximately 70% of Hypri's energy needs
- **Waste Removal** – Pressurized air channels waste from dwellings through the hollow core of the spire and out exhaust vents near the base
- **Climate Control** – Regulated airflow provides natural cooling throughout warmer months and circulates heated air during colder periods
- **Pressurization** – Maintains stable atmospheric pressure within enclosed spaces despite the city's elevation
- **Agricultural Systems** – Powers automated farming operations, seed distribution, and produce transportation

The crown jewel of this system is the Atmospheric Retention Network—a series of specialized vents and pressure chambers that work in concert with the gravity ore to maintain breathable air density throughout the inhabited sections of the spire. Without this system, the residents of Hypri would require specialized breathing apparatus or pressure suits at such extreme elevations.

The vent system's engineering brilliance lies in its exploitation of the natural pressure differentials created by the spire's height and the World Gyre's consistent flow patterns. The result is a nearly self-sustaining system that requires minimal external energy input.

However, this system does create significant waste accumulation zones at the base of the spire, particularly in areas where air currents deposit solid waste. While [[Sibannac]]'s carpet consumes much of this organic matter, large areas of non-degradable waste have formed over centuries, creating a stark contrast between the magnificent airborne city and its less pristine foundation.

### Wind Highways and Inter-Spire Travel

While Hypri itself is a single massive spire, it maintains connections to other smaller spires across southern [[Usaka]] through an ingenious system of "wind highways"—artificially maintained air corridors that neutralize or redirect the [[World Gyre]]'s natural currents. These highways allow airship travel against the otherwise prohibitive clockwise flow that dominates the [[Current Line]].

Each highway is maintained by a series of massive wind manipulation towers that create counter-currents and zones of calm, allowing pilots to navigate between destinations without fighting the gyre's natural force. The highways connect Hypri to the three other major spire cities of Usaka:

- **[[Ventari]]** – The northern central spire city, known for its scholarly institutions
- **[[Aeradyme]]** – The northwestern spire complex, famous for its artistic communities
- **[[Zaphira]]** – The western outpost city and gateway to [[Theologia]]

A particularly notable wind highway extends from Zaphira to the continent of [[Theologia]], enabling one-way travel to this narrow western landmass. However, no return highway exists due to the strength of opposing gyre currents, requiring travelers to take sea passage to [[Tayim]] to secure airship transport back to Hypri.

These wind highways are maintained through cooperative agreements between the spire cities and represent one of the region's most valuable pieces of shared infrastructure. The responsibility for their upkeep falls primarily to the [[Hypri Highcourt]], with [[Siela Qane]] overseeing most operations due to her expertise in aerial pressurization magic.

### Pressurization Magic and Outlawed Practices

Pressurization magic is deeply ingrained in Hypri's culture and technological development. Practitioners manipulate air pressure and density to create effects ranging from small bursts of controlled wind to massive atmospheric shifts.

The three sisters of the [[Ahdom Few]] are considered the foremost masters of pressurization magic, each specializing in a different form:

- **[[Jarma Konich]]** – Land pressurization, manipulating solid matter through compression and decompression
- **[[Siela Qane]]** – Air pressurization, controlling gaseous elements and atmospheric conditions
- **[[Ximena Lathen]]** – Water pressurization, influencing liquid states and hydrodynamics

While pressurization magic is celebrated and widely practiced, gravity magic is strictly prohibited within Hypri. Despite this ban—or perhaps because of it—underground cults focused on gravity manipulation have emerged among younger citizens. These groups, collectively known as the [[Falling Stone Covenant]], practice forbidden techniques that directly interact with the gravity ore inside the spires.

The Hypri Highcourt maintains that tampering with the gravity stones could destabilize the entire city, potentially causing catastrophic collapse of the spire ecosystem. This conservative stance has created tension with youth movements that see gravity magic as their birthright and the next frontier in Hypri's magical development.

## Cultural Diversity and Belief Systems

Hypri is the most culturally diverse city in Toma, hosting adherents of numerous religious and philosophical traditions. The native population, known as [[Dweller]]s, maintains the oldest belief systems centered around the spires themselves and [[Sibannac]].

Major belief systems include:

- **Spire Veneration** – Native Dweller practice focusing on the spiritual significance of the spires
- **Sibannac Offerings** – Ceremonial practice of casting deceased bodies from the spires as offerings to the grass deity
- **[[Gludestit]]** – Ancient worship of [[Hidraal]] maintained by some traditionalists
- **[[Asceptim]]** – Imported faith gaining popularity under [[Siela Qane]]'s influence
- **[[Klesn]]** - The phylum of the Chain of Delta.
- **[[Candela]]** - A rapidly growing phylum of southeast Wyldere.
- **[[Adescep]]** - A recent denomination of Asceptim sprouting in [[Concordia]].
- **[[Ashprahm]]** -
- **[[Primalism]]** -
- **[[Innderdualism]]** -
- **[[Roundezvi]]** -
- **[[Pria]]** -
- **[[Preservus]]** -
- **[[Oshe]]** -
- **Various Nesa Devotions** – Worship of different deity-like beings



<div class="feathermark">
    <p class="feathermark-attribution">Corvi's Feathermark</p>
    <p>
    The term "Nesa" actually has Usakan origins, referring to powerful entities believed to exist beyond mortal perception. Hypri scholars maintain extensive records of Nesa manifestations throughout history, making the city an important center for theological study.

## Economy and Resources

### The Trade Belt and the Soil Inn

The economic center of Hypri is the **Trade Belt**—a multilevel, spiraling marketplace and trade district carved into the spire between 7,200–7,800 meters. The Trade Belt is a chaotic yet structured space buzzing with trade, air traffic, and magical logistics, wrapping around the spire and home to the Splint, the gravity-cracked heart of Vespir.

Within the Trade Belt lies the **Soil Inn**, the most famous inn in Hypri. The Soil Inn serves traders, dignitaries, travelers, and locals, and is named after a beloved local poem connected to [[Sibannac]]. It functions as both a cultural center and commercial hotspot, but it is not the name of the entire marketplace.

Major exports from Hypri include:

- **Cultivated Clay** – Processed by Konich devotees for pottery and construction.
- **[[Moluk]]** – A clay substance developed by Jarma Konich that doubles as a mild intoxicant.

_Moluk is illegal for consumption and trade within Hypri, but Jarma Konich is legally permitted to export it elsewhere with government approval. Hypri benefits from these exports, and Moluk is allowed to enter the city only for immediate export. Occasionally, criminals have attempted to steal Moluk by breaking onto [[Mudship]]s—airships used for hauling Moluk—before the shipments can leave Hypri._

- **Gravitationally-Altered Materials** – Unique substances processed in the unusual conditions near the Splint
- **Cartographic Services** – Highly detailed maps of Usaka created by explorers who navigate Sibannac's Carpet

## Foreign Relations
<!--
### Relationship with the Chain of Delta

Hypri maintains complex diplomatic and trade relationships with the [[Chain of Delta]], particularly through [[Jarma Konich]]'s partnership with [[Fuscia Lustin]]. This arrangement has led to Hypri becoming a significant production center for substances exported to the Chain, particularly [[Moluk]], which has gained popularity as an inexpensive recreational drug.

This economic relationship has created tension with [[Siela Qane]]'s religious aspirations and [[Ximena Lathen]]'s isolationist tendencies, representing the internal conflicts among the Ahdom Few.

-->

### Relationship with Sibannac and the Usakan Growth

Hypri's relationship with Sibannac and the Usakan Growth is defined by suspicion, fear, and cultural prejudice. While Sibannac is officially recognized as a deity and practical partner in waste management and defense, the city's government and native population—especially the Dwellers—view the lower ground and its Growthmind society as a threat to their autonomy and identity.

Hypri's media, art, and education systems are built around a narrative that positions Sibannac as a cautionary figure. In plays, children's books, and public stories, Sibannac is depicted as a beautiful, seductive woman who ultimately slaughters or enslaves those too weak to resist her. This story is used to empower the native population and maintain a strong sense of nationalism, especially among the small core of Dwellers who see themselves as the true proponents of Hypri's legacy.

The stories serve to unite the native population against outside influence, especially through means of ignorance of the Usakan Growth societies below. While many traders and visitors pass through Hypri for commerce, the city's core identity is fiercely protected by these narratives.

<!--
In reality, Sibannac does not kill those who are weak; instead, she allows them to fade within her societies. In the Usakan Growth, one's [[Will]] is heavily decayed, but life is good from a communal and cultural standpoint. Disease is a risk for those who do not wear protective clothing, as waste is used as fertilizer and recycled into infrastructure and technology. The contrast between Hypri's nationalist myth and the lived reality of the Growthmind below is a source of ongoing tension and misunderstanding.

## Historical Connections

### Hidraal and the Spawn

Though not commonly known among average citizens, Hypri's ruling class maintains knowledge of the city's connection to [[Hidraal]], the ancient three-headed hydra who once dominated the region through the [[Gludestit]] phylum. After Hidraal's beheading, her three heads became the primordial serpents now known as the [[Spawn of Hidraal]]:

- [[Lopali]] – The Serpent Ray, a Ferra-Water Natura hybrid controlled by Ximena Lathen
- [[Kautiger]] – The Oedipwyrm, a multi-headed Ground Natura-Celia hybrid controlled by Jarma Konich
- [[Qa'ura]] – The Amphiptere serpent with crystalline features controlled by Siela Qane

Some scholars have theorized connections between the Ankelore in the Splint and the ancient Hidraal, suggesting the fissure might be a wound left from the primordial conflict that resulted in Hidraal's beheading. While the Highcourt officially dismisses such claims, the close guarding of the Splint and the obsessive monitoring of the Ankelore lend credence to the notion that the resource may have deeper significance than publicly acknowledged.

A fourth entity, [[Hathakrik]], represents Hidraal's regrown body but resides in the separate realm of [[Dar]] rather than Toma.

The Ahdom Few's true ambition—kept secret from all but their closest confidants—is the eventual reunification of these serpents to restore [[Gludestit]] and liberate primordials from [[Hoard Sickness]], though each sister has different visions of how this should be accomplished.
