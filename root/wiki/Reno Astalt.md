# Reno Astalt

> _“Given too much space, tradition can rule a nation bar of all questions. Huma is a population of questions, it never was a hunting dog inside of a cage, as you would be made to believe void of inquiry. Tradition is a skeleton, one of yesterday’s questions; its flesh has long since rotted so I beg you to not eat what they feed you.”_
> **- Reno Astalt, "The ATK Pocketbook"**

> _"Tradition is a set of solutions for which we have forgotten the problems"_ 
> **- Donald Kingsbury**

**Reno Astalt** was a controversial philosopher, theologian, and self-published author in the [[Current Line]] of Toma. He is best known for his work, [[Astalt's Theory of the Kingdoms]], which challenged traditional views on the nature of the kingdoms and the concept of purpose.

Astalt's approach was unconventional: rather than publishing through established academic channels, he released a series of pocketbooks aimed at making his ideas accessible to a younger and broader audience. These pocketbooks distilled the main points of his much larger, more complex treatise on the kingdoms, focusing on the practical and philosophical implications of his studies.

Astalt's central claim—that "purpose" is the only objective truth in reality, and that all that does not approach this is subjective—sparked significant debate and led to the Sanctan adoption of [[Purpose Taxonomy]] in place of the older [[Social Taxonomy]] following the academic works of the [[Sol Reformation]]. His work remains influential, especially in lesser educational institutions and among those seeking to understand the deeper meaning behind the structure of Toman society.
