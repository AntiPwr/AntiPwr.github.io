# Deck of the Naive
The Deck of the Naive is the starter deck for the Belief Gambit Sorcerer. This information does not include the details of all cards, as they are not all known.

The **Deck of the Naive** is the starting deck for [[Belief Gambit (Sorcerer Origin)]]. The DM is expected to create a unique deck for their player, possibly renaming it along the way. The Deck of the Naive should reflect the setting and should be used to guide player understanding and engagement of the world.

As an example of a Deck of the Naive, below I have provided one based in the [[Toma]] setting. This deck is inspired by the basic knowledge of the kingdoms. Some of these cards are considered more powerful than other cards that can be made by the Belief Gambit Sorcerer at low levels. These cards are meant to give the player a taste of some of the unique effects possible through creation. If you are a dungeon master, you should consider changing some of these cards to reflect their backstory, if you do not create your own deck outright. The purpose of this class is to immerse the player and proper preparation goes a long way. For example, the character this deck was designed for was born in Concordia, therefore one of their Huma cards is based on this fact. 

## Using These Cards

• Unless otherwise stated, you activate a card’s effect by using your Action (essentially “throwing” or presenting the card).

• If an effect requires a target to make a saving throw, use your Spell Save DC (or a reasonable DC chosen by the DM if you do not have one).

• Most effects last for a short duration (often 1 minute, or 1 hour) or until you end them (no action required unless otherwise stated).

• The DM should feel free to adjust the flavor and specifics of each card to best suit the campaign, backstory, or setting.

<!--## Nesa -->

<!--### Prayer’s Relief

Card Art: A priestess lying injured on the ground, reaching toward a luminous horizon. A glowing ray of light stretches back toward her in response.

Effect (1 Action):

You touch one creature and grant it a sudden burst of resolve. That creature gains advantage on its next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes within the next minute. Once it uses this benefit, the effect ends.

Balancing Note: This is effectively granting “Inspiration” on demand. At low levels it’s still quite strong, but only applies to one roll.

<!--### Daichot

Card Art: A glass-like humanoid figure stares out at the viewer, while an entity of shadow or void massages its shoulders from behind.

Effect (1 Action):

Choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, you and the target swap your current hit points for up to 1 minute.

• Tracking Damage: While swapped, if either you or the target takes damage, reduce the current hit points of whichever “pool” is currently assigned to that body.

• Ending the Effect: If either of you drops to 0 hit points, or when 1 minute passes, the effect ends immediately. Both of you revert to the same current hit point totals you had before the swap (ignoring any changes made in the interim).

Balancing Note: This can be very powerful if used on a higher-HP ally or enemy. Reverting at the end prevents permanent exploitation and reduces weird edge cases (e.g., “immortality”). You might require the user to concentrate on this effect so it ends if they lose focus.

## Spira

### Dance of Pigs

  **The mechanical details of this card are unknown, as it was traded to [[Corvi]].**

Card Art: A pen of dancing, spectral pigs. One pig teleports from one side of the fence to the other, kicking up mud.

<!-- 
Effect (1 Action, Concentration, up to 1 Minute):

Choose up to five creatures you can see within 30 feet of you. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target is influenced by the swirling, whimsical energy of Spira’s pigs for the duration:

• Restriction: If an affected creature ever attempts to move more than 60 feet away from you, it must first succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or immediately use its movement (if available) to move closer to you (essentially staying within 60 feet).

At the end of each of its turns, an affected creature can repeat the saving throw, ending this effect on itself with a success.
 -->

### Possession

Card Art: A halfling family relaxing under a large tree. Two thick roots wrap around them protectively.

Effect (1 Action, Concentration, up to 1 Hour):

Choose one nonmagical object you can see within 60 feet of you. Your mind and senses transfer into that object, and your body becomes incapacitated while you remain merged:

• While possessing the object, you can see, hear, smell, taste, and feel from its location, just as though you occupied its space.

• You retain your normal senses (darkvision, etc.) as appropriate, but cannot move the object unless it has a normal means of locomotion.

• As an action, you can return to your body, ending the effect immediately. If your concentration ends for any reason, you also return to your body.

## Bluma

### Sunbeam Spark

Card Art: A lone flower in a cavern, bathed in a single beam of light from a crack above.

Effect (1 Action):

A radiant beam erupts in a straight 15-foot line originating from you. Each creature in that line must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 radiant damage. Creatures that fail the save are briefly covered in small glowing flowers until the start of your next turn.

### Production

Card Art: A large fruit-bearing tree with thick, drooping branches. The fruit glistens with succulent flesh.

Effect (1 Action):

Your choice of either both arms or both legs magically transforms into large, edible fruit for up to 4 hours. During this time:

• A creature can use its action to take a bite. Each bite restores hit points drawn from a pool equal to half your maximum hit points total.

• You are effectively missing whichever limbs you transformed (DM discretion for mobility or combat penalties).

• After 4 hours, or if the pool of healing is depleted, your limbs regrow and function normally again.

## Decara

### Nowhere, Everywhere

Card Art: A skeletal, sinewy hand reaches out of a small hole in a tree, grasping a man’s shirt. The man is being pulled inside, though the hole is far too small.

Effect (1 Action):

Choose one creature within 100 feet that you can see. Until the end of your next turn, the first time you hit that creature with an attack while you have advantage, the attack becomes a critical hit. Once this critical hit occurs (or if your next turn ends), the effect ends.

### Tunnel

Card Art: A miner stands transfixed by a glittering blue ore vein. A lanky Decaran climbs the wall behind him, eyes fixed on the same vein.

Effect (1 Action):

You rapidly burrow up to 30 feet through loose, earthen material (dirt, sand, clay, etc.) and emerge in an unoccupied space you can see at the end of this tunnel. The tunnel remains for 1 round, during which any willing creature can follow you through. After 1 round, the tunnel collapses.

## Ferra

### Apex, Praeda I.

Card Art: A bestial figure stands at a crossroads, part of it fierce and predatory, another part lithe and evasive.

Effect (1 Action, Concentration, up to 1 Minute):

Choose one of the following forms for the duration:

• Predator: Whenever you deal damage with a weapon or spell attack, you deal 1 additional point of that damage type.

• Prey: Your walking speed (or another chosen speed you possess) increases by 5 feet.

### Hoard

Card Art: A primordial figure perched atop a towering heap of gold and treasure.

Effect (1 Action, Concentration, up to 1 Hour):

Whenever you personally reduce a creature to 0 hit points during the effect, you can use a reaction to magically absorb the corpse into this card. That corpse is instantly transmuted into 5 gp (or a similar small treasure).

• You can only transmute a number of corpses up to your proficiency bonus while concentrating on this effect.

• This has no effect on creatures with no discernible corpse (e.g., constructs, oozes, undead that crumble to dust, etc.), or powerful creatures above CR 1 (DM’s discretion).

## Celia

### Debilitating Spore

Card Art: A noxious puff of spores spreading from a small mushroom, aimed toward an unsuspecting target.

Effect (1 Action):

Choose one creature within 30 feet of you. It must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage and have disadvantage on its next attack roll before the end of its next turn.

### Reborn

Card Art: A wilted figure stands up from the dead, animated by fungal growth and luminescent spores.

Effect (1 Action, Concentration, up to 1 Hour):

**Option 1:** Spores of Rebirth (Mark a Living Creature)

Choose one Medium or smaller creature within 60 feet that you can see. That creature becomes Spore-Marked for 1 hour or until your concentration ends. If the creature dies while marked:

- It is instantly resurrected as a [[Reborn Locelia]], taking on a fungal mimicry of its original form (a dog becomes a fungal dog, a humanoid becomes a fungal husk, etc.).
- The Reborn Locelia rolls its own initiative and is under your control for 10 minutes or until your concentration ends.
- After the duration, the Reborn Locelia collapses into inert spores.

**Option 2:** Raise from Spores (Resurrect a Dead Creature)
Choose the corpse of a Medium or smaller creature that died within the past 7 days. As long as enough of the body remains to house a fungal core, it is resurrected as a Reborn Locelia with half its original hit points.

- The creature retains no memories but obeys your simple verbal commands.
- It survives for 10 minutes or until your concentration ends.
- After the duration, it collapses and can no longer be resurrected using this method.

The reanimated creature is not hostile toward you unless you or your allies harm it, but it will defend itself if threatened. Depending on your reputation, shared [[Will]], or [[Inoculation]] through the [[Celia]] [[Kingdom]], the creature may be friendly.


## Huma

### Concordian Council

Card Art: A stone-walled chamber with robed figures gesticulating at one another in an endless debate.

Effect (1 Action, Concentration, up to 1 Minute):

Choose one creature within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become stunned as it is mentally pulled into a vision of the Concordian Council’s endless negotiations.

• At the end of each of its turns, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself with a success.

• Maintaining the Debate: On each of your turns, you must use your action to sustain the Council. If you do anything else, or if your concentration is broken, the effect ends immediately.

<!-- ### Lichen Pearl

Card Art: A gleaming opalescent pearl surrounded by dark green lichens and vine-like tendrils.

Effect (1 Action):

You plant a small seed in fertile ground (or suitable soil) within 5 feet of you. A glowing flower blooms there, radiating healing energy in a 5-foot radius for up to 4 rounds:

• At the start of each of your turns, each ally (including you) within 5 feet of the flower regains 1d4 hit points.

• The flower withers after 4 rounds or if it is uprooted/destroyed.

-->

  



## Monstra

### Fearful Presence

Card Art: The perspective of someone on the ground as a menacing orcish brute looms in a doorframe, embers swirling behind.

Effect (1 Action):

Choose one creature within 15 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it becomes Frightened of you for up to 1 minute.

• At the end of each of its turns, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

<!-- ### Scam

Card Art: A sly goblin with a crooked grin, clutching a small pouch of coins.

Effect (1 Action):

For the next 1 minute, you have advantage on all Charisma (Persuasion) and Charisma (Deception) checks.
