# Deck of the Naive


The Deck of the Naive is the starter deck for the Belief Gambit Sorcerer. 


The **Deck of the Naive** is the starting deck for [[Belief Gambit (Sorcerer Origin)]]. The DM is expected to create a unique deck for their player, possibly renaming it along the way. The Deck of the Naive should reflect the setting and should be used to guide player understanding and engagement of the world.

As an example of a Deck of the Naive, below I have provided one based in the [[Toma]] setting. This deck is inspired by the basic knowledge of the kingdoms. Some of these cards are considered more powerful than other cards that can be made by the Belief Gambit Sorcerer at low levels. These cards are meant to give the player a taste of some of the unique effects possible through creation. If you are a dungeon master, you should consider changing some of these cards to reflect their backstory, if you do not create your own deck outright. The purpose of this class is to immerse the player and proper preparation goes a long way. For example, the character this deck was designed for was born in Concordia, therefore one of their Huma cards is based on this fact. 

## Huma: Lichen Pearl

As an action, the caster summons an enlarged pearl that hovers 10 feet in the air as if it was floating in water. The pearl emits a healing aura. Allies within 5 feet of the pearl regain 1d6 hit points for every turn the caster remains in Stagnant State and lasts up to 5 turns. Meditation range is up to 20 feet from the pearl.
