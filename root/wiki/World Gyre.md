# World Gyre

**Bin:** [[Scape]]  
**Basin:** [[Sacrus]]  
**Eco:** [[Toma]] of [[Toman Ecoss]]

The **World Gyre** is anatural phenomenon caused by the [[Dance of Spira]], leading to the rotation of natural elements across the plane. This gyre influences tectonic activity, ocean currents, wind patterns, and the movement of souls, playing a crucial role in the ecological and spiritual balance of the Toman Ecoss.

#### Tectonic Plates

The World Gyre affects the movement of landmasses, causing them to shift in a vortex-like pattern outward from Arkon. This process is responsible for the formation of mountains, trenches, and other geological features. As plates move toward the edge of the world, they gradually lose mass, falling off to become [[Goda#Tactical Creation|Detritus]], which the Goda use to fuel further creation.

**Mountains and Trenches**: Mountain ranges form through the subduction of tectonic plates, creating angled shapes influenced by the Dance of Spira. This results in varied terrain, with mountains and trenches developing at angles toward the dance's rotation.

**Lowland and Highland Patterns**: The frequency of shifts in the Dance of Spira determines the periods of highland and lowland development. Longer intervals between shifts lead to lowland periods, while more frequent shifts result in highland periods.

#### Ocean and Currents

Ocean currents are directed outward from Arkon, influenced by the Dance of Spira. They circulate in either a clockwise or counterclockwise rotation, occasionally shifting direction.

**Currents**: The currents are strongest in the outer regions of the Straits of Gorisain, with speed influenced by the number of souls in Arkon. Trenjor's belief sphere affects currents in northwest Ka'Vit, creating unique conditions.

**Depth**: Ocean depths fluctuate with the movement of tectonic plates, creating dynamic marine environments.

#### Wind Patterns

Wind flows outward from Arkon, with speed and direction affected by the Dance of Spira and the number of souls present. In the inner regions of Ka'Vit, the Soul Well acts as the eye of a storm, with calmness determined by soul release.

### Role of Behinyu

Behinyu plays a significant role in the World Gyre by guiding souls through the [[Dance of Spira]]. Souls released by [[Never]] and sent to Behinyu are directed to sources of belief, providing anima to sustain Toma's ecosystems. If a soul loses its belief source, it follows the World Gyre toward the edge of the plane, seeking new belief. Failure to find a new source results in falling off the edge and facing [[Mixture Death#Solution Death|Solution Death]].

### Influence and Legacy

The World Gyre is integral to the balance and harmony of Toma, shaping its landscapes, ecosystems, and spiritual dynamics. By regulating the movement of souls and natural elements, it ensures the continued evolution and vitality of the Toman Ecoss. The interaction between the gyre, the Dance of Spira, and Behinyu highlights the interconnectedness of the material and spiritual realms, fostering growth and enlightenment for all inhabitants.








World Gyre rate of change has a positive exponential

Sol Unita believes the plane is getting hotter, because of the World Gyre swapping direction towards them following the Line from Few.

The biomes are shifting in the direction of the gyre. [[Natura Nesa]] uses detritus to fuel the growth of the plane. This will be a Nesa of Fealty spawned from the [[Autom Liberation]] maybe. Currently, the Goda do this.


The Gyre Shift refers to the change in rotation of the [[World Gyre]], signifying the end of a Line.
