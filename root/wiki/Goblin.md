Goblins encompass the human fear of being cheated, scammed, lied to, or manipulated for someone elseâ€™s greedy desires. This fear is called Goblphobia.



When someone gets scammed by a goblin, it is called getting gobbled.

In legend, they came from nature and acts as a force that combats the growth of Huma society by stealing their money and repurposing it to the better the plane rather than the Huma kingdom. There are times where goblins may not be evil to Huma, which is an uncommon trait of Monstra. However, generally if greed is understood within a Huma, it is met with a reactionary response of greed and manipulation in order to scam the individual of their valuables, only for the goblin to later use this gold to better the plane of Toma.

Goblins are resource hungry creatures that engage in trade very commonly.

[[Monstra]]
There are different types of goblins. Generally, two of these goblins are typically seen as the same race with different mental traits. 20% of the goblin population exhibit bloodthirsty and power-hungry traits. These are essentially alpha goblins. They typically are in positions of power, whether through social influence or physical strength. The other 80 percent typically serve the upper 20% as lesser goblin minions of their influence. 

The upper 20% also are exhibit heightened traits, whether it be discipline, intelligence, physical strength, creativity. They do so to incur their bloodthirsty and power-hungry perspective. The main hatred of the goblins are the Huma, as all Monstra were designed to combat the progress of Huma.
