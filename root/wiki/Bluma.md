**Eco:** [[Toma]]  
**Kingdom:** Bluma

The **Bluma** kingdom encompasses all plant life within [[Toma]], from the smallest mosses to the vastest sentient grasslands. Defined by their capacity for growth, photosynthesis, and ecological interconnection, Bluma species are the foundation of most terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.

## Purpose and Empire Function

In the [Purpose Taxonomy](Kingdom.md), Bluma's **Empire Function** is **Production**â€”the creation of energy, matter, and structure that supports all other kingdoms. Bluma species convert sunlight and nutrients into the biomass that sustains animal, fungal, and even sentient life.

## Organization and Subkingdoms

Bluma includes a wide variety of subkingdoms and forms, from simple algae to complex flowering plants and sentient growthminds like [[Sibannac]]. Some Bluma entities, such as Sibannac, possess advanced consciousness and can form collective intelligences (Growthminds) that rival or surpass animal societies.

## Cultural and Ecological Role

Plants in the Bluma kingdom are not passive; they organize, communicate, and even govern through mechanisms like the Growthmind. Many societies in Toma, especially in [[Usaka]], revere Bluma entities as deities, ancestors, or essential partners in survival.
