A **familial** is an insignia used to tie creatures to belief systems. These insignias are most commonly attached to [[Phylum|phyla]], [[Class|classes]], [[Order|orders]], and [[Family|families]]. Familials in the [[Toman Ecoss]] fulfill the role a flag does in the [[Earthen Ecoss]]. Carrying a familial is a sign of one's allegiance and conviction in their belief, but it can be dangerous if you venture into hostile territories or speak to the wrong person.

Wearing a familial, due to its danger as an adventurer, is seen by others (at minimum, those of the same belief system) with admiration. Familials are sometimes used in social hierarchy systems, with governing forces using tiered or varied familial production.

## Main Section

Familials are more than mere symbols—they are deeply personal. In some societies, the familial is a badge of honor, while in others, it may be a mark of rebellion, or political affiliation. The act of wearing or displaying a familial is a statement of identity and conviction to a way of being.

### Familials in Asceptim and under Sol Unita

[[Asceptim]] familial designs, for example, vary highly, as they are individually created by followers throughout a person's life—a cultural expectation. [[Sol Unita]], as a government, propagates this idea and teaching into society. This reflects an idea present in Asceptim teachings, derived from the Rite of Passage: "We are as similar as we are different."

## Inspiration

Familials draw inspiration from real-world flags, crests, and religious insignias, but are uniquely shaped by the cultures and belief systems of the Scape world.
