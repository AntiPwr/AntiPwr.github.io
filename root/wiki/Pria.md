**Bin**: [[Scape]]  
**Basin**: [[Sacrus]]  
**Phylum**: [[Pria]] ([[Gludestit]] and [[Primalism and Advancism#Advancism|Advancism]])

**Pria** is a subphylum of **[[Gludestit]]** that emerged in response to the oppressive rule of the **[[Tayim Trade Republic]]** and the ideological conflict that culminated in the destruction of [[Old Badaba]] during the **[[Battle of the Banquet]]**. This belief system blends the primal energies of nature with the rebellion against colonial control, focusing on the [[Primalism and Advancism|Advancism]] philosophy that reveres nature’s intrinsic power. The rise of Pria coincided with the popularization of exotic creature trade on Babadoo Slim, particularly the influence of [[Primordial]]s.

### **Cultural Significance**

The New World [[Simi]], primary adherents of Pria, rejected the rigid spiritual controls of Ashprahm, which sought to maintain a hierarchical relationship between humans and nature. Instead, they embraced the Pria belief system, which teaches that all life is part of a grand cycle of death and rebirth, represented most profoundly by the [[Celia]] entities that arose during the Battle of the Banquet.

### **Beliefs and Practices**

Followers of Pria believe that life is inextricably linked to death, and that through purposeful acts of killing and sacrifice, the land can be nourished, renewed, and sustained. Unlike the Tayim Trade Republic’s suppression of individuality, Pria encourages personal connection with nature’s forces. The natural world is seen not as something to be controlled but to be worked alongside, a belief embodied in the rituals that focus on honoring Primordials and encouraging natural resonance with [[Bluma]], [[Ferra]], and Celia.

### **Impact on New Badaba**

As New Badaba rose from the ashes of Old Badaba, Pria became the central belief system guiding its people. The Pria followers embraced the decomposition and rebirth brought by the Celia, turning the ruins of Old Badaba into fertile agricultural land that now sustains New Badaba’s economy. The Celia are seen as divine agents of nature, their influence revered and encouraged through rituals that facilitate their life-giving processes. Pria’s practical and spiritual approach to life’s cycles also deeply influenced the culture of the island, leading to a society more attuned to the natural balance than its Tayim predecessors.

### **Inspiration**

The Pria belief system is inspired by indigenous spiritual movements that emphasize a deep connection to the natural world, life cycles, and the interplay of life and death. It draws on the importance of rebellion and resistance to oppressive regimes, similar to the cultural histories of many indigenous groups in regions like the Americas, who resisted colonial imposition through spiritual and cultural resilience. The reverence for death as a necessary part of life’s continuation echoes the cyclical nature of many ancient beliefs tied to nature's power.
