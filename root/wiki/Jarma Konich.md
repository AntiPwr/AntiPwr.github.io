**Bin:** [[Scape]]  
**Basin:** [[Sacrus]]  
**Eco:** [[Toma]] ([[Usaka]]) of [[Toman Ecoss]]  
**Kingdom:** [[Huma]]  
**Phylum:** [[Subjectivism]]
**Class:** [[Hypri Highcourt]]  
**Order:** [[Ahdom Few]]  

Jarma Konich is one of the three serpent sisters who comprise the [[Ahdom Few]], the ruling council of [[Hypri]]. As Land Trielder, she oversees territorial management, resource acquisition, and the city's material production. Her mastery of solid pressurization magic—the ability to manipulate the density, structure, and movement of earth and stone through precise pressure control—has earned her the title "Mistress of Clay" among Hypri's artisan communities.

**Appearance**

Jarma Konich is a striking figure, her presence marked by a practical, earthy aesthetic. She has black hair that is a little curly and often a bit messy, giving her a look of someone who spends more time working with her hands than tending to her appearance. Her skin is pale but rarely appears clean; it is almost always stained with soft traces of soil, soot, or clay, a testament to her constant involvement in the city's material production and clay cultivation. Jarma's clothing is utilitarian and typically incorporates shades of brown, with black thin roping used both functionally—to tie robes together—and decoratively, as minimalist rope jewelry. She rarely incorporates color into her attire, and when she does, it is subtle and hidden among her otherwise earthy garments, allowing any small hint of color to stand out all the more. This understated approach to dress both reflects and reinforces her reputation as a master of the material world, grounded and unpretentious, yet never careless.

Unlike her more reclusive sister [[Ximena Lathen]], Jarma maintains a highly visible public presence, regularly engaging with trade guilds, production facilities, and the flourishing drug export business she has developed through her controversial partnership with [[Fuscia Lustin]] of the [[Chain of Delta]]. As Drakemaster of [[Kautiger]], the multi-headed Oedipwyrm, she controls one of the most physically intimidating [[Spawn of Hidraal]], using its earth-shaping capabilities to support her economic enterprises.

## Origins and Public Identity

### Family Background

Jarma Konich was born into a family of skilled artisans who specialized in pressure-based clay techniques. While not of noble birth like her sister Ximena, Jarma's exceptional talent for solid manipulation brought her to the attention of early [[Hypri Highcourt]] members, who recognized the potential strategic value of her abilities.

Like her sisters, Jarma modified her surname to better integrate with Hypri society, though her transformation was less dramatic than Ximena's complete break with her past. She maintains connections with her extended family, many of whom now occupy privileged positions within the [[Moluk]] production guilds.

### Rise to Power

Jarma's ascension to the position of Land Trielder came through a combination of demonstrated magical prowess and shrewd economic maneuvering. By revolutionizing clay cultivation techniques through the application of precise pressure magic, she created new industries that rapidly became central to Hypri's economy.

Her partnership with the other sisters of the Ahdom Few was formalized during a period of political instability approximately sixty years ago, when the three women combined their complementary powers to stabilize the city's governance and establish their tripartite rule through control of the primordial serpents.

## Solid Pressurization Magic

### Theory and Practice

Solid pressurization magic represents Jarma's contribution to the sisters' complete mastery of pressure-based magical disciplines. While [[Ximena Lathen]] controls liquids and [[Siela Qane]] manipulates gases, Jarma's domain is the manipulation of solid matter through precisely controlled pressure applications.

The fundamental principles of her magic include:

- **Compression Artistry** – The ability to compress materials to alter their density, strength, and physical properties
- **Structural Reformation** – Reshaping solid objects by applying targeted pressure to specific points
- **Earth Flow Control** – Making seemingly solid materials flow like liquids by manipulating their pressure states
- **Crystallization Acceleration** – Using pressure to rapidly form crystalline structures in suitable materials

These techniques form the foundation of Hypri's clay cultivation industry and have applications in construction, artistic creation, and material science throughout the city.

### The Clay Cultivators Guild

Jarma personally oversees the [[Clay Cultivators Guild]], an elite organization that trains promising practitioners in solid pressurization magic. Unlike Ximena, who rarely shares her knowledge, Jarma actively promotes the spread of her techniques—though she reserves the most advanced applications for her inner circle.

The guild maintains extensive cultivation fields at the base of Hypri's spires, where they process specialized clay extracted from Kautiger's workings to create [[Moluk]] and other valuable substances. Guild membership is highly coveted, offering both social prestige and significant economic opportunity.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Land Trielder of Hypri

As Land Trielder, Jarma's official responsibilities include:

- Management of Hypri's territorial holdings and border security
- Oversight of mining, agriculture, and resource extraction
- Regulation of construction projects and infrastructure development
- Administration of waste management systems at the spires' bases

Her approach to governance emphasizes practical results and economic growth, sometimes at the expense of environmental concerns or long-term sustainability. This pragmatism has occasionally created tension with both her sisters, who tend to favor more ideological approaches to leadership.

### Drakemaster of Kautiger

Jarma maintains a powerful bond with [[Kautiger]], the Oedipwyrm—a multi-headed Ground Natura-Celia hybrid descended from one of [[Hidraal]]'s three original heads. This massive creature, with its numerous clawed appendages capable of burrowing through earth and rock, represents the solid aspect of the primordial serpents controlled by the Ahdom Few.

Through her connection to Kautiger, Jarma gains enhanced earth-manipulation abilities and access to the creature's instinctual understanding of geological processes. She uses these powers to locate valuable mineral deposits, create specialized clays for Moluk production, and occasionally demonstrate her authority through dramatic earth-shaping displays.

    <p>Oh, how deliciously ironic! The self-proclaimed "Mistress of Clay" shapes her little pots and sculptures while remaining completely blind to how thoroughly she herself has been molded! Round and round she spins on another's wheel, thinking herself the potter rather than the clay!</p>
    <p>Her partnership with Fuscia Lustin? A masterful sleight of hand where both believe they've manipulated the other, while Kautiger's influence seeps through the cracks in Jarma's consciousness, drop by crystalline drop. That multi-headed horror doesn't serve her—it's conditioning her through classical methods even Lustin would admire!</p>
    <p>Watch her hands during diplomatic meetings—fingers twitching in patterns that mirror Kautiger's appendages. Listen to her speech patterns—the rhythmic pauses matching the wyrm's burrowing cadence. The clay she so proudly manipulates contains microscopic fragments of Kautiger's shed skin, creating a chemical bond that strengthens with each handling.</p>
    <p>Most delightful of all? The Moluk trade she believes is her crowning achievement actually serves Kautiger's purpose perfectly—spreading tiny particles of itself throughout the Chain, creating a vast network of infinitesimal connections that will one day form a perfect resonance pattern. When that pattern completes... well! Let's just say Jarma won't be the one calling herself "master" anymore!</p>

### Economic Partnerships

Jarma has established a controversial but highly profitable partnership with [[Fuscia Lustin]], a powerful figure in the [[Chain of Delta]]. This arrangement has transformed Hypri into a significant production center for [[Moluk]]—a substance derived from Kautiger's clay that serves as both a nutritional supplement and mild intoxicant.

While originally developed as a sustainable food source for Hypri's growing population, Moluk has gained popularity throughout eastern Toma as an inexpensive recreational drug. Jarma oversees its production and initial processing, while Lustin handles distribution through Delta's extensive trade networks.

This economic relationship has created tension within the Ahdom Few:
- [[Ximena Lathen]] views it as potentially compromising Hypri's independence
- [[Siela Qane]] objects to the recreational use of what she considers a sacred substance

Despite these concerns, the arrangement has brought substantial wealth and influence to Hypri, reinforcing Jarma's position within the Highcourt.

## Reputation Among the Dwellers

Jarma Konich's reputation among the native Dwellers of Hypri is notably low. In closed circles, Dwellers often discuss their suspicions that Jarma harbors ulterior, self-centered motives, believing that her policies and economic maneuvers are designed primarily for her own benefit rather than the common good. While there is some truth to these claims—Jarma is indeed pragmatic and ambitious—the Dwellers' reactionary stance and persistent distrust only serve to reinforce her willingness to act against their interests. This feedback loop has led to increasingly exclusionary policies, especially regarding the regulation of Moluk and the management of Hypri's resources, and has fueled a cycle of mutual antagonism between Jarma and the small but vocal Dweller population.

## Legal Status of Moluk in Hypri

Moluk, the clay-derived substance central to Jarma's economic strategy, is technically illegal for consumption and trade within Hypri itself. However, Jarma Konich is legally permitted—by special approval of the Hypri government—to produce and export Moluk to other regions. This arrangement allows Hypri to benefit from Moluk exports without officially sanctioning its use among its own citizens. Moluk is allowed to enter Hypri only for the purpose of immediate export, and any local distribution or consumption remains strictly prohibited. Despite these regulations, criminal activity persists: there have been several incidents where thieves have broken onto [[Mudship]]s—Moluk-hauling airships—attempting to steal shipments of the valuable substance before it can leave Hypri's airspace.

## Personal Ambitions and Methods

### The Clay Mixer Society

Beyond her public roles, Jarma leads the secretive [[Clay Mixer Society]]—a cult-like organization centered around the consumption and ritual use of specific Moluk formulations. This society operates from [[Clath]], a nascent [[Imaan Plane]] developing under Jarma's guidance as a specialized environment for potmakers and clay artisans.

The society's members believe that by consuming clay mixtures derived from Kautiger, they establish a direct connection to primordial earth energies. This practice is framed as both spiritual communion and practical skill enhancement, though outside observers have noted that it also creates intense loyalty to Jarma personally.

### Vision for Gludestit Restoration

Like her sisters, Jarma seeks the eventual reunification of the [[Spawn of Hidraal]] to restore [[Gludestit]] and address the [[Hoard Sickness]] afflicting primordials. However, her approach differs dramatically from her sisters':

- While [[Siela Qane]] believes restoration should occur through incorporation with [[Asceptim]] and [[Asath]]
- And [[Ximena Lathen]] favors a carefully controlled [[Imperial Growth]] strategy
- Jarma advocates integration with the [[Chain of Delta]]'s economic systems

Her vision involves using the Chain's vast commercial networks to gradually distribute aspects of Gludestit belief throughout Toma, creating a foundation for eventual reunification through trade rather than conquest or religious conversion.
