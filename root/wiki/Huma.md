# Origin

**Huma** are the most biodiverse creatures in the **[[Toman Ecoss]]**, representing intelligence, adaptability, and the desire to learn. Huma civilizations have developed over time, gaining a profound understanding of their world and using that knowledge to influence other creatures and even shape new kingdoms. One of the greatest achievements of the Huma was the creation of the **[[Automata]]** Kingdom, which was constructed by the Huma of **Delta** in **Vokar**.

# Rise and Fall?

As a species, Huma stand at the forefront of intellectual and societal evolution. They possess an innate drive to expand their understanding of the world and influence the ecosystems around them. However, this drive comes with inherent challenges, as the Monstra kingdom is directly tied to their rise and fall.

The [[Purpose Marking]] of the Huma represent their potential for growth and creation, known as the "Rise." However, the Huma also carry the inherent risk of transforming into **Monstra** when overcome by fear.
