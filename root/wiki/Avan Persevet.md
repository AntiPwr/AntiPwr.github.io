# Avan Persevet

<img src="wiki_images/Avan Persevet.png"></img>

>_"In my hours prior to death, I knew it so as I know it now, even in this great service beyond. 
When my body is lifted, the true 'I' will have finally met a drop of knowledge worth value.
My soul is, and will be, taught a universal truth—
as I have lived with eyes unclosed, even in the nourishment of sleep.
This endless surge of thoughts I bear are mere dreams sent unto the world;
only in life's banish am I now aware:
my mind did not once brandish.
Thus, this is my drop of truth, the only I declare."_
> **- Avan Persevet, [[Letter to the Lost]]**

**Avan Persevet** is the founder and first leader of the [[Tildohsi Partition]], renowned for his role in ensuring the survival of his people within the uncertain refuge of the [[Clutched Forest]]. Once a citizen of [[Delta]], Avan was [[Deathlist|deathlisted]] by the [[Chain of Delta]] for uniting people against the state during the political rise of [[Fuscia Lustin]]. This later resulted in the forest being advanced upon by the [[Kleznit Advance|Imperial Army of Delta]], an event known as the [[212 Shift]] in the Partition's history.

## Early Life and Exile

Avan Persevet was a prominent figure in Delta, known for his charisma and ability to inspire dissent against the autocratic rule of the Chain. Fearing the growing merger of politics and industry, Avan warned that the Omep Regions would become tools for the state, eliminating social mobility and individual freedom. His activism led to his exile, but Avan continued to influence Delta from afar.

## The Poisoning of Vokar

Operating from outside Delta, Avan managed to sway people to his cause by poisoning naturally-occurring photometal veins in [[Vokar]] soil, harvested after the mass death of [[Bluma]] in the region. This act allowed his ideas to spread rapidly among the disillusioned populace once the photometal was harvested for the development of [[Okog|okogs]] in [[Rasm]].

## Founding the Tildohsi Partition

Avan and his followers found refuge in the [[Clutched Forest]], where they established the Tildohsi Partition. His leadership and strategic acumen were instrumental in uniting [[Huma]], [[Ferra]], [[Automata]], and [[Celia]] into a symbiotic society capable of resisting outside threats.

## The 212 Shift

When the Chain of Delta sent the imperial army known as the [[Kleznit Advance]]—primarily [[Willed-Mecha]]—to eliminate Avan and his movement, Avan's intuition and reaction allowed the Partition to survive the chaos that followed. The resulting battle, known as the [[212 Shift]], was not orchestrated by Avan, but his leadership ensured the survival of his people and is celebrated as a foundational moment in Partition history.

## Final Years and Sacrifice

Years after the 212 Shift, Avan lived in paranoia, knowing that winning a war against the Chain would not be possible unless ample time was given to Tildohsi. He understood that he needed to mislead the Chain once again—this time, by convincing their intelligence that they had finally caught Avan off guard. If he could achieve this, Tildohsi would gain the time needed to operate under the Chain's radar for years to come. Avan promised his people that he had given them everything they needed; his mind had been emptied to those who needed to understand what he knew. Now, it was time for him to sacrifice his life for the future of his people and, ultimately, the downfall of the Chain's tyranny in years to come.

<!-- NOTE: More information about Avan Persevet's final action and sacrifice will be added in the future once decided. -->

## Legacy

Avan Persevet is remembered as a visionary leader, a master strategist, a martyr, and ultimately a symbol of resistance against the Chain's tyranny through means of intellect and tight-knit dissemination of information. His actions continue to shape the culture and identity of the Tildohsi Partition and the wider Clutched Forest region.
