The Current [[Question]] is the purpose of the current universe.

# Linearity vs. Laterality

The current [[Question]] focuses on exploring the coexistence and reconciliation of linear and lateral-minded creatures, as well as anything in between. It seeks to find a harmonious balance between these opposing mindsets within the [[Omnis]].

## Role of the Creators

- **Bin 0 ([[Scape]])**: The Omnis aims to produce the most lateral-minded person as the Creator of Bin 0, emphasizing dynamic interactions, creativity, and spontaneous evolution. This universal soul entity is known as the [[nth Creator]].

- **Bin 1 ([[Scape (TTRPG)/Other Side]])**: Conversely, the most linear-minded person is sought to lead Bin 1, focusing on order, structure, and sequential progression. This universal soul entity is known as the [[1st Creator]].

### Universal Goal

The Omnis seeks to solve the Question by alternating creation between Bins 0 and 1. This process allows for a comprehensive exploration of duality and natural opposition, fostering growth, adaptation, and balance.

## Resolution and Stability

### Solving the Question

Once the Question is solved, the Bin achieves a state of permanent existence without Creator's fear of collapse. It attains an infinite life cycle within the stability shaped by its Creator or Creators, ensuring the continuity of its cosmic role. A new pair of bins is then made to allow for a new Question to be solved.

### Transitioning to New Questions

With each resolution, the Soul Engine sets forth a new Question, introducing a fresh cosmic challenge that demands new mindsets and solutions. This cycle ensures the Omnis' continued growth and evolution.

## Impact on Souls and Creation

### Crea's Role

[[Crea]], the fundamental energy that drives the growth and decay of the universe, plays a crucial role in the process of creation and transformation. It is the source of vitality and change, fueling the dynamic evolution of the Omnis.

### Soul Dynamics

The Question guides how souls are used as fuel for creation, transforming and integrating them into new cosmic iterations. This process ensures continuity and renewal across successive universes.

### Creation Cycles

The Question directs the alternation of creation between Bins 0 and 1, allowing for diverse and adaptive cosmic dynamics. This cycle fosters exploration, experimentation, and resolution of dualities.

# Linearity vs. Laterality

The current [[Question]] focuses on exploring the coexistence and reconciliation of linear and lateral-minded creatures, as well as anything in between. In this context, "linear" refers to an individualistic, microcosmic, and sequential approach to existence and creation, while "lateral" refers to a collectivist, macrocosmic, and holistic approach. The Question seeks to find a harmonious balance between these opposing mindsets within the [[Omnis]].

## Role of the Creators

- **Bin 0 ([[Scape]])**: The Omnis aims to produce the most lateral-minded person as the Creator of Bin 0, emphasizing collectivist, macrocosmic, and lateral approaches to achieving a perfect universe. This universal soul entity is known as the [[nth Creator]].
- **Bin 1 ([[Other Side]])**: Conversely, the most linear-minded person is sought to lead Bin 1, focusing on individualistic, microcosmic, and linear approaches to perfection. This universal soul entity is known as the [[1st Creator]].

### Universal Goal

The Omnis seeks to solve the Question by alternating creation between Bins 0 and 1. This process allows for a comprehensive exploration of duality and natural opposition, fostering growth, adaptation, and balance.

## Resolution and Stability
