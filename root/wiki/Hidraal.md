**Bin**: [[Scape]]  
**Basin**: [[Sacrus]]  
**Eco**: [[Scape (TTRPG)/1 Purpose Taxonomy/Complete Taxonomy/02 Eco/01 Toman Ecoss/02 Toma/Toma]] of [[Toman Ecoss]]

**Hidraal**, also known as the Beheaded Hydra, was an ancient and malevolent Nesa, a god-like being within the Toman Ecoss, devoted to hoarding all forms of wealth, resources, and power. Hidraal was a three-headed hydra, each head possessing its own intelligence but lacking executive function, which resided in the central body of Hidraal.

### Characteristics

- **Hoarding Nature**: Hidraal’s obsessive hoarding led to the accumulation of vast resources, including resonant creatures and powerful artifacts. This hoarding behavior is the reason for the existence of large resonant creatures during Hidraal’s time, as she sought to control and possess all forms of life and power.
- **Infection by Gorisain**: Hidraal was eventually infected by **[[Gorisain]]**, who twisted her nature to view all sickened creatures as threats to her hoard. This led to a ruthless campaign of extermination against those infected with **[[Gorosis]]**. This campaign began from the inside, drawing all believers of Gludestit to see one another (mainly primordials, but growing to powerful belief spheres as well) as enemies so long as they existed. [[Hoard Sickness]] exists to this day in most primordials, thus why there are often very separated from each other geographically.
- **Downfall**: Hidraal’s greed and subsequent weakening led to her eventual downfall. Her body was beheaded, and her three heads were separated, each becoming a separate entity known as the **[[Spawn of Hidraal]]**.

### Legacy

Hidraal's influence persisted through her spawn, three primordial serpents that continue to exist within the Toman Ecoss. These serpents, if ever reunited, could potentially challenge the current ruling powers of **[[Apex and Praeda]]**. The [[Ahdom Few]] aim to reunite the sisters and bring back [[Gludestit]], liberating the primordials of their Hoard Sickness, but they disagree on how it should be done. [[Siela Qane]] claims it should be done through incorporation with Asceptim and Asath, [[Jarma Konich]] with the [[Chain of Delta]], and [[Ximena Lathen]] with her [[Imperial Growth]]



The death of Hidraal and Juud occured at around the same time, considered major losses of belief prior to the ramp-up to the War of Conclusions and the lines end. It is joked and considered irony that Hidraal was said to be slain with an axe (beheaded), and Judd, the tree, was killed by greed. You would think it be the other way around.
