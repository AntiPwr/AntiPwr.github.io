**Bin**: [[Scape]]  
**Basin**: [[Sacrus]]

**Kingdom**: [[Anthros]] (**Simi**) 

The **Simi** are a subkingdom of simian [[Anthros]] originating from the [[Agresta Jungle]]. They are a diverse and widespread group, with populations found in various regions, including the aforementioned Agresta Jungle, north [[Blulech Marsh]], and the isle of [[Babadoo Slim]]. The Simi are divided into two distinct groups: the Old World Simi, who are more primal and instinct-driven, and the New World Simi, who are known for their higher intelligence and organizational skills.

The Old World Simi are primarily found among the [[Stomach Reavers]], where their primal instincts and ferocity are put to deadly use in their pirate activities. These Simi are less concerned with the complexities of society and more focused on survival and dominance, making them ideal members of the Reavers. The New World Simi, on the other hand, are often found in more structured and hierarchical groups, such as the [[Hacienda Band]], where their intelligence and cunning are valued traits.

The Simi speak two languages: [[New World]] and [[Old World]], reflecting the cultural and regional differences between the two groups. The New World Simi are often bilingual, using New World for trade and diplomacy, while Old World is reserved for more traditional and internal matters. The Stomach Reavers, being primarily composed of Old World Simi, use Old World as their primary language, with New World used sparingly, mainly for interactions with outsiders.

The Simi are a complex and multifaceted people, with a rich cultural heritage that reflects their diverse origins and environments. Whether in the dense jungles of Agresta or the grim shores of Jalaâ€™s Rest, the Simi continue to play a significant role in the broader tapestry of the Toman Ecoss.
