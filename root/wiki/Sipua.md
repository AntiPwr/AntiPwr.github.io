Sipua is a [[Sol Unita]] order governing the Agresta region, renowned for its focus on resource acquisition, research, and harmonious integration of land and sea. Once known as the Sipua Research Center (SRC) before the [[War of Conclusions]], Sipua has evolved from a pre-solarpunk industrial complex into a rapidly developing city that brings together [[Zothros]], [[Anthros]], and [[Huma]] in pursuit of sustainable progress.

## Overview

Sipua is a vibrant, research-driven order at the heart of the Agresta region, designed to mimic the "catching" principle of Southcatch but with a unique aquatic and ecological focus. The city is a living experiment in sustainable development, where underwater and coastal infrastructure blend seamlessly with lush jungles and coral reefs.

The majority of Sipua's residential and commercial districts are found underwater, built among coral reefs and teeming with aquatic life. Sunlight filters through the water, illuminating domed research centers, gardens, and bustling marketplaces. The continental part of Agresta is dedicated to agriculture and sustainable industry, supporting the city's food and resource needs while preserving the region's biodiversity. Ocean channels and manmade rivers connect every part of Sipua, supporting trade, transportation, and the movement of species between habitats.

Sipua is a melting pot of Huma, Anthros, and Zothros, attracting researchers, innovators, and settlers from across Toma. The order is known for its remarkable biological diversity, with research and conservation at the core of city policy. Advanced techniques for sustainable harvesting of ocean and jungle resources are a hallmark of Sipua's approach, and its social and economic systems are designed to foster cooperation between land and sea dwellers, as well as between different species and ideologies.

Originally established as the Sipua Research Center (SRC), the city was transformed by the aftermath of the War of Conclusions. Its pre-solarpunk roots are still visible in its architecture and ethos, but Sipua now stands as a beacon of rapid, harmonious development and cross-kingdom collaboration. The city is often described as an aquatic Scender, with a focus not only on aquatic life but on the flourishing of all forms of life, both above and below the water.
