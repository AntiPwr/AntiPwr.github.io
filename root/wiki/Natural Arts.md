# Natural Arts

**Eco:** [[Toman Ecoss]]

The **Natural Arts** constitute the academic studies of the physical realm and their underlying elemental forces. Researchers in this field record and analyze geological formations, meteorological patterns, and astronomical phenomena, employing both empirical observation and theoretical modeling. Investigations focus on the interactions between earth, water, air, and fire, as well as the role of [[Natura]] in shaping natural landscapes and ecosystems. Comparative analyses are conducted between observed phenomena and ancient lore, with hypotheses continually refined through field experiments and interdisciplinary collaboration.
