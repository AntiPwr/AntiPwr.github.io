Where belief flows, anim follows. You have been granted the power of a magical sleeve of cards, bound to you, whether by blood, enchanted tattoo, or some other means. This sleeve is capable of storing cards that, when thrown, can paint an accurate picture of the world at large—or conversely, a skewed view. A Belief Gambit Sorcerer is both a craftsman and a student of perception and nuance, choosing to empower their adventuring prowess through the values of others and themselves.


### Playing as Belief Gambit

The Belief Gambit Sorcerer is a class unique from all others in Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition because it requires a great amount of communication between the DM and the player. This subclass makes it necessary for the DM to improvise the creation process and balancing of cards. This should be done based on the amount of effort and time taken to build the card, the character’s level and understanding of the world, as well as whatever other factors the DM sees fit. This class is highly experimental and should not be used without proper preparation. A Belief Gambit Sorcerer can fit infinitely many roles in game due to the flexibility of the Sleeve of Depiction, later referenced.


#### Windows of Perception

Cards have the power to capture the essence of life in its rawest form. Akin to the painter and his brush, the Belief Gambit Sorcerer and other cartisans capture scenes of life through their own medium, the card. At 1st level, you gain proficiency with Cartist’s Kit.

Decks and individual cards can be created using a [[Cartist's Kit]]. Decks of cards follow card types and a theme, as defined by either the DM or the player through their creation. Decks must have a theme which they are based on. Some examples of deck themes include kingdoms, religions, or locations.

#### Sleeve of Depiction

At 1st level, you gain access to a magical card storage system, capable of holding multiple decks of cards at once, as well as switching between them. This card sleeve, or other storage item of your choice, is bound to you. If you lose this item in any way, you can recover it by using an action. The sleeve comes with a starter deck and an empty deck. These decks can be used alongside Cartist’s Kit in order to store cards for combat use. The current deck in use can be swapped with a bonus action. Additionally, this sleeve acts as your spellcasting focus.

As an action, you can choose to draw a card from your active deck and target a creature. The first time you use this action per turn, you can instead choose to hold the card in your hand and cast a cantrip targeting a creature. The card in your hand fades away if it is not used by the end of your next turn or if 30 seconds pass outside of combat. For flavor, spells can be cast in the form of magical cards thrown, so long as the components of the spell are not altered.


##### Deck of the Naive

At 1st level, you gain [[Deck of the Naive]] as your starter deck. The Deck of the Naive contains 20 unique cards.

Like all decks, these cards are imbued with the essence of belief, reflecting a certain perspective or dynamic. This deck is built on the theme of Kingdoms, with each card fitting into specific card types:

Deck of the Naive card types include Bluma, Celia, Decara, Ferra, Huma, Monstra, Natura, Nesa, and Spira. In a different setting, this deck can be made up of uniquely themed cards better suited for your world.


#### Predict

At 6th level, your attunement to the Sleeve of Depiction deepens, allowing you to glimpse the weave of fate through your cards. As an action, you can expend 2 sorcery points to activate this ability. When you do, reveal the top three cards of your current deck. You may choose to reorder these cards as you wish or place one of them at the bottom of the deck, then draw the next card for immediate use. This ability can be used a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), regaining all expended uses after a long rest.


#### Reveal Hand

At 14th level, your Sleeve of Depiction becomes a conduit for potent magic. As an action, you can expend 5 sorcery points to shuffle your deck and draw three cards at random. These cards manifest their effects immediately, whether beneficial or detrimental, determined by the DM based on the card’s theme and the current situation. After using this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.

Additionally, gain an additional empty deck slot in your Sleeve of Depiction.


#### Universal Wisdom

Upon reaching 18th level, your mastery over the arcane and your Sleeve of Depiction reaches its zenith. You gain the ability to command the very essence of magic stored within your cards, allowing you to perform feats of sorcery that bend the bounds of reality.

As a bonus action, you can expend 3 sorcery points to recall any card from your deck to your hand, disregarding the usual draw mechanism. This card can be played immediately as part of the same bonus action, applying its effects as determined by the DM.

Additionally, once per long rest, you can initiate a Grand Gambit, a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform and requires the expenditure of 7 sorcery points. Upon completion, you draw the top five cards from your deck and lay them out in front of you. These cards, through your intense magical focus and the powers granted by your subclass, combine their essences to create a singular, monumental effect.
