Tekyum is an [[Asceptim#Maxims|Asceptim Maxim]] that declares technology should be completely interwoven into society to achieve maximum efficacy and growth towards ascension. There are two main families that devolve based on differences regarding body modification and belief in the true composition of an ascended Huma:

# Expressive Tekyume

Expressive Technohumanism

Majority (92)

The belief that body modification should create the perfect human after birth. Physical modifications are seen as a way of life and in certain places a societal norm. Body modification is seen as an art form to many members [[Sol Unita]].

 *The word Expressive, is not denoted in the names of churches or religious titles due to this form of Tekyume being of the main Asceptim maxim. For example, a sanctuary named the "Sanctuary of Rai" would follow the Expressive Tekyume without any need for indication.*
  


# Perfect Tekyume

Perfect Technohumanism

Minority (8)

Perfect Technohumanists believe the perfect Huma is decided at birth and only genetics will prove to produce an ascendant being. These Asceptists believe that no amount of body modification will bring you closer to ascension, both individually and as a whole.

The idea that the perfect human should be created through the means of technology prior to birth. This minority believes that a creature is not truly prepared for ascension if they are not perfect from the beginning.

*The word Perfect is denoted in the names of churches or religious titles as it is a deviation from the main Asceptim maxim. For example, the Perfect Church of Eim, would refer to a church that follows the values of Perfect Tekyume.*
