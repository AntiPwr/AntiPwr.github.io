# Belief

**Eco**: [[Toman Ecoss]]

In the [[Toman Ecoss]], belief is not just a concept; it is a perceivable force that shapes reality. It manifests in various forms, such as faith, desire, knowledge, and instinct.

### Understanding Belief

Belief in Toma acts as a multifaceted resource, forming the basis of creation and interaction with the environment. Belief is propagated through experience and evolution. It is thought to consist as a composition of the following:

- **Desire**: Channeling raw emotions and personal wants.
- **Faith**: Drawing strength from religious or spiritual convictions.
- **Knowledge**: Utilizing understanding and wisdom.
- **Instinct**: Relying on gut feelings and primal urges.

### Creation of Belief

Belief is generated in the material realm through a creatureâ€™s brain, through a unique connection to the [[Pith]]. This belief is then expressed as an aura around a creature, known as a [[Belief Pool]], forming the basis of comparison from the individual and the environment. Belief pools are further explored later in the [[Belief#Belief Pools|Belief Pools]] section.

### Belief as a Tangible Force

1. **Dynamic Interaction**:
    - Belief is not static; it dynamically interacts with the environment and individuals, shaping and being shaped by surrounding belief systems.
2. **Personal Reflection**:
    - Belief reflects the inner psyche of a creature, revealing hidden aspects and providing a path for character development and exploration.

### Role in the Toman Ecoss

Belief serves as a foundation for various aspects of life and magic in Toma, influencing how inhabitants interact with their world and each other. Its role includes:

1. **Cultural Significance**:
    
    - Different cultures place varying levels of importance on belief, seeing it as a divine gift or a force requiring regulation.
2. **Community Dynamics**:
    
    - Belief influences community cohesion and structure, impacting leadership and social hierarchies.
3. **Strategic Layer**:
    
    - Players can strategically manage their beliefs to unlock new abilities, alliances, and insights as they align with certain beliefs or cultural norms. This is explored in the [[Merchant System]].

### Connection with Anima

Belief directly influences the flow and potency of [[Anim]], the essence of life and magic in Toma. As belief grows stronger, so does the anima, enabling inhabitants to perform extraordinary feats tied to their convictions.

### Belief Pools

In the Toman Ecoss, every living creature radiates an aura known as a [[Belief Pool]] or Conviction Aura from their [[Common Anatomy#Pith|Pith]]. These pools are extensions of a creature's mind into their environment and are shaped by the beliefs and perceptions of the world and others.

1. **Nature of Belief Pools**:
    
    - Belief pools are gradually formed through perceptual intake and cognitive processes, reflecting how a creature is perceived by those around them.
2. **Interaction with Spira**:
    
    - In the [[Soul Fields]], Spira may be drawn to belief pools, feeding off the aura of belief generated by the individual's core.
3. **Potency and Duration**:
    
    - The influence of a belief pool varies with the strength of the beliefs it absorbs, growing more potent and influential with consistent reinforcement.
4. **Environmental and Mental Influence**:
    
    - Belief pools can subtly alter the environment and influence the minds of those nearby, shaping interactions and perceptions in noticeable and imperceptible ways.

### Role in Gameplay

Belief provides a justification for interactions and environmental changes:

- **Sensing Power**: Characters can sense the power of other creatures through their belief pools.
- **Social Dynamics**: Perceptions influence social interactions, with strong belief pools causing reactions like reverence, intimidation, or distrust.
- **Environmental Influence**: The cumulative effect of belief pools can alter surroundings, subtly shaping the environment to reflect prevailing beliefs.
