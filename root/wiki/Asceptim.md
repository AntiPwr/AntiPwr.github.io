Asceptim is a Sanctan [[Phylum]] most notably governed and advanced by [[Sol Unita]], centered on the pursuit of [[Sol Proscima]], the state of ultimate fulfillment and enlightenment thought to exist in an unseen celestial geography. Its teachings are based on the metaphor of sunlight evaporating water—where the people are the water, and their actions propagate life until they ascend beyond the material world into Sol Proscima. This belief is foundational to the societal and spiritual structures of Sol Unita, where Asceptim serves as both a faith and a guiding philosophy for governance.

## Key Concepts and Beliefs

- Sol Proscima is the ultimate goal of Asceptim. It represents a state where all desires have been fulfilled, and no further action is required. The term is derived from the Presceptist prefix "prosc," meaning the elation of total accomplishment. Asceptim followers believe that through enlightenment and ascension, they will transcend into this state of being and exist in a location of eternal satisfaction.
- [[Rites of Huma]] are spiritual maxims that guide followers on their path toward ascension. These rites form the foundation of Asceptim doctrine, detailing how individuals should live, govern, and interact with others. The most revered of these is the [[Rite of Passage]], the original doctrine that sets the precedent for all spiritual and societal progress.

## Asath

Asath, also known as The Eye, is a [[Nesa]]. Followers of Asceptim perceive Asath, the sun, as the ultimate force of creation and ascension, believing that its light provides the energy necessary for growth and transcendence.

## The Rites of Huma

The [[Rites of Huma]] were formalized collectively during the [[Line from Few]] by the [[Scepitath]]. These rites serve as a spiritual and ethical code that all Asceptim followers must adhere to, ensuring that their lives align with the goal of Sol Proscima.

## Religious Leadership and Structure

The religious hierarchy of Asceptim is led by Guides, spiritual leaders who interpret and lobby the growth of the Rites of Huma. Their primary role is to assist followers in navigating their journey toward Sol Proscima by ensuring adherence to the faith’s principles. These guides act as both theologians and political figures of academic merit, influencing governance, education, and cultural institutions.

Unlike many hierarchical religious structures, Asceptim does not have a single ultimate leader. Instead, it follows a distributed religious authority, where multiple royal families uphold doctrine, with leadership shifting in accordance with the [[Rite of Transference]]—ensuring that those with superior insight into faith and governance take precedence. Although, there is a Queen of Scender, but her job is as interadvocate of progress, or as uniting means to Sol Proscima.

## Symbolism of Sunlight and Water

The core metaphor of Asceptim is that of sunlight evaporating water, illustrating the transformation of the soul from material existence to spiritual ascension.

- The sunlight represents divine guidance, illuminating the path to Sol Proscima.
- The water symbolizes the followers, with their actions and beliefs dictating their eventual rise beyond the physical world.
- The process of evaporation mirrors ascension, as individuals leave behind material limitations to achieve enlightenment.

This metaphor is woven into the architecture, governance, and educational systems of Scender, reinforcing the belief that faith and personal progress are inseparable.

## Cultural and Religious Impact

Asceptim is deeply embedded in Sol Unita’s governance, law, and education, shaping both individual lives and collective society. The faith emphasizes personal growth through structured guidance, ensuring that all members contribute toward the ultimate goal of Sol Proscima.

The influence of Asceptim extends to major ceremonies, such as the [[Ceremony of His Eye]], where devout followers undergo ritualistic blinding as a testament to their faith. Additionally, the teachings of Asceptim inform Sol Unita’s strict yet meritocratic policies on leadership, business, and social mobility, ensuring that only those who prove their worth may rise within the system.
