Isaheim Maddows starts the Red Wave, a bacterial horde that attempts to sweep through Delta starting from Almalek and climbing through the Omep Regions until reaching the Illid Munis, where Fuscia's reign can end, and Isaheim Maddows's can begin. This occurs in the [[Current Line]] and is the result of Isaheim Maddows receiving [[Gorosis]] following a [[Triarch]] meeting in the West [[Summons]]. This bacterial disease grows and his appearance slowly shifts towards a crimson fleshy red. He attempts to hide it to stay in power but [[Gorisain]]'s [[will]] begins to take over. When this reveal happens, the Red Wave will begin, and slowly, from Almalek->Rasm->Kleznit->Estal Link->Illid Munis, waves of Decarans consumed from soul-bearing populations of these regions will wage war on Delta. This propagation of Decarans will struggle to break through Kleznit. The Red Wave is a civil war between Almalek and the Medan using a contract with Gorisain to do so. This is how Gorisain attempts to breach through the Deltan armies at [[Sutresh]] where the Second Endemic War ([[Current Line]]) is occuring. During this Triarch meeting, Isaheim hears a blaring scream of terror ([[Gorisain]] manifestation), like a person stressing their vocal chords to a violent snap. It screams abusive words into Isaheim's belief pool, making him question his own beliefs, telling him he is better off dead living the way he is. This screaming voice is demeaning and forces Isaheim into a change of allegiance, no longer with the Medan, although publicly he hides this for a while. The plan for the Red Wave begins to consume his mind, attempting to justify it and claim that he could unite the Decara with the Chain, or perhaps hold them back once Fuscia gives up power. Fuscia doesn't give up power, and neither does Gorisain. This is a lose-lose situation for Isaheim which is justified by the mental distortions of Gorisain's will eating at him over time ever since the first scream manifestations. Eventually, the Omep regions will reach a state of safety, but Almalek will be captured. From this point on, more waves will occur, but more intermittently rather than the massive swarm upon his Isaheim's reveal.

Isaheim Maddows wears purple cloth and has green flames from his skeletal lich body. When revealed he will have red flames.

Isaheim Maddows is a unique type of lich, 

Isaheim Maddows is genderless


heading: Isaheim's Reveal 
is the moment that the gorosis (Decaran) form is revealed. The light green flames will turn to crimson and the skeletal body will begin to grow a fleshy form around it, almost forming into a creature from the inside out (Mimid). This mimid is based on Isaheim's past life
