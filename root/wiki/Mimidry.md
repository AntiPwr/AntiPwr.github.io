# Mimidry

## Overview
Mimidry is a unique form of adaptation possessed by the Decara kingdom, allowing certain Decaran creatures (mimids) to mimic traits and physical forms of other kingdoms while retaining their bacterial composition. This ability sets mimids apart from regular mimics, as their transformation is rooted in bacterial resonance and not mere illusion.

## Biological Mechanism
Mimidry involves the reconfiguration of bacterial mass, enabling mimids to warp their bodies into the likeness of other beings. This process is both physical and spiritual, drawing on the Decara's connection to Gorisain and the Soul Fields. The transformation is often accompanied by ritualistic decay and feasting, further binding the mimid to its new form.

## Cultural Significance
Mimids are rare and revered within Decaran society, seen as living embodiments of adaptability and destruction. Their existence is a testament to the Decara's relentless pursuit of ascension and dominance. Mimids often serve as agents of change, infiltrating other kingdoms and spreading the Decara's influence.

## Differences from Mimics
Unlike regular mimics (such as those found in the Spira kingdom), mimids retain their bacterial essence and are driven by the Decara's ideology of destruction. Their mimicry is not limited to appearance but extends to function and purpose, making them formidable adversaries and valuable assets in the Decara's quest for power.
