**Bin**: [[Scape]]  
**Basin**: [[Sacrus]]  
**Eco**: [[Scape (TTRPG)/1 Purpose Taxonomy/Complete Taxonomy/02 Eco/01 Toman Ecoss/02 Toma/Toma]] of [[Toman Ecoss]]  
**Kingdom**: [[Resonant]]  
**Phylum**: [[Gludestit]]

**Gludestit** was a phylum led by the Nesa **[[Hidraal]]** during the **[[Taxotheir Line|Taxotheir Line]]** and **[[Cel Blindbirth Line|Cel Blindbirth Line]]**. The Gludestit phylum was dedicated to the accumulation and hoarding of resources, following Hidraal’s teachings that survival depended on controlling both natural and spiritual wealth.

### Characteristics

- **Hoarding Philosophy**: Gludestit was built on the belief that hoarding resources and power was the key to survival and dominance. This led to a culture where creatures grew in power by consuming and absorbing the beliefs and essences of others, often through cannibalistic practices.
- **Decline**: In the **[[Current Line|Current Line]]**, Gludestit has become an endangered phylum, largely replaced by the sister phyla of **[[Mohrsmünt]]** and **[[Amarvena]]**, led by **[[Apex and Praeda]]**. The remnants of Gludestit are mostly followed by the few remaining Primordials who still adhere to Hidraal's teachings, as well as some pirates who believe Hidraal will rise from the depths of the sea and spread her planar wealth to all one day.

### Legacy

Despite its decline, the legacy of Gludestit lives on through the stories of Hidraal and her spawn, as well as in the scattered followers who continue to practice the hoarding philosophy in secret. The Gludestit teachings have also influenced other kingdoms, leading to the spread of Primordials beyond the Ferra kingdom.
