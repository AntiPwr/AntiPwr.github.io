**Bin**: [[Scape]]

_"The pursuit of evil has proven to be a form of art for the Huma, whether by innate nature or belief. Over countless years, morality has been toyed with, and in fact created to describe our actions. It seems as if all Huma have conditioned an acceptance of wrongdoing as a naturally occurring learning process. I wonder, however, if intelligence is truly the one with bloody hands, or perhaps something greater. A process akin to instinct."_

Gorisain is a formidable and fearsome [[Nesa]] of the [[Decara]] kingdom, embodying the essence of destruction and decay within the [[Toman Ecoss]]. Known by many names, Gorisain's influence permeates through the realms as the embodiment of suffering and chaos.

### Appearance

Gorisain is depicted as a colossal and ominous figure, exuding an aura of malevolence and power. His form is shrouded in darkness, with tendrils of shadow constantly shifting and writhing around him, symbolizing the chaotic and destructive nature of his domain. His eyes are like burning coals, reflecting the suffering and torment he inflicts upon the world.

### Domains

Gorisain is the god of suffering, bacteria, death, sin, pestilence, murder, and massacre. His influence extends over all aspects of decay and destruction, making him a constant threat to the balance and harmony of Toma.

### Gorisain's Fealty

"You have granted me this staggering, yet imaginable power, a fraction of what perfect fantasy I was promised. A dirty backwash and pity to my very existence. Now you expect of me this and that, still, you expect anything from me! I desire growth, to thrive, yet you expect me to subsist rather than spread into the pores of every waking creature and indoctrinate every mind, only to then feast upon the beliefs of which I planted in the very seed of my infection. It is an inevitability, extrema as the blind heathens called it."

Gorisain's fealty to [[Zlellis and O'nume]] is to act as a force of chaos and destruction within the plane, counterbalancing growth and promoting [[Goda#Harmony|Harmony]]. Unlike other Nesa, Gorisain harbors ambitions to ascend and overthrow the true gods responsible for his pain, seeking to become a god in his own right.

### The Carrion Prophecy

Gorisain is the prophesied ascendant in the Carrion Prophecy, which foretells his rise to power through cooperation with other creatures. However, the Decarans, being extensions of Gorisain himself, cannot aid in his ascension. This prophecy drives Gorisain's actions and ambitions, as he seeks to fulfill his destiny and achieve ultimate control.

### Gorrbis and the Living Terrain of Dar

[[Dar#Gorrbis|Gorrbis]], the living terrain of Dar, is a manifestation of Gorisain's power and influence. As Decarans consume and produce biowaste, Gorrbis molds and adapts, reflecting the chaotic and transformative nature of Gorisain's domain. This living landscape acts as a direct extension of Gorisain's will, constantly reshaping to accommodate the Decara's destructive tendencies and serve as a symbol of his relentless pursuit of power.

### Influence and Legacy

Gorisain's presence is a constant reminder of the destructive potential within Toma. His influence extends beyond the Decara, affecting all creatures and kingdoms within the Toman Ecoss. As the embodiment of suffering and decay, Gorisain's actions shape the course of history and the evolution of the plane, leaving an indelible mark on its landscape and inhabitants. Through Gorrbis, Gorisain's reach extends even further, entwining his legacy with the very fabric of Dar itself.














Gorisain, in his catatonic state subconsciously influences the Decara, which are really pieces/copies (as they are bacteria) of him, to claim the belief pools and bring Gorisain out of his slumber to combat the holder of the Whisper (Kee) and reclaim his power, as well as propagate/find the Carrion, as stated in the Carrion Prophecy.
