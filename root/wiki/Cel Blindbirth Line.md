**Bin**: [[Scape]]  
**Basin**: [[Sacrus]]  
**Eco**: [[Scape (TTRPG)/1 Purpose Taxonomy/Complete Taxonomy/02 Eco/01 Toman Ecoss/02 Toma/Toma]] of [[Toman Ecoss]]  
**Kingdom**: [[Huma]]

The **Cel Blindbirth Line** is a significant period in the history of the Toman Ecoss, characterized by the overwhelming presence of **[[Celia]]** and the drastic reduction in the Huma Kingdom's population. This era followed the **[[Taxotheir Line|Taxotheir Line]]** and preceded the **[[Line from Few|Line from Few]]**, marking a dark chapter in the annals of Toma's history.

### Overview

The Cel Blindbirth Line is named for the "blind birth" of Celia, which refers to the rapid and uncontrollable spread of these entities due to the mass deaths during the Taxotheir Line. The immense surplus of decaying organic material created fertile ground for Celia to thrive, resulting in their dominance over the landscape. The Huma Kingdom, already ravaged by warfare during the previous line, suffered catastrophic losses, with the population falling by 97%.

### Subterranean Shift

As Celia and **[[Primordial|Primordials]]** began to overrun the surface of Toma, the remaining Huma were forced to retreat underground. These subterranean societies became the last bastions of Huma life, as the conditions above ground were no longer survivable. This period of forced isolation and adaptation led to significant cultural and historical changes, with much of the previous history being rewritten or lost in the depths.

### Key Events

- **Nascension of Chantae**: During the Cel Blindbirth Line, **[[Chantae]]** underwent **[[Source Surge Types#Nascension|Nascension]]**, becoming the **[[Nesa]]** of Celia. This event further solidified the dominance of Celia during this period, as Chantae's influence spread across the Toman Ecoss.
    
- **Population Decline**: The Huma Kingdom experienced its most severe population decline during this line, with a staggering 94% of the population perishing. This decline was a direct result of the warfare and environmental collapse caused by the unchecked spread of Celia and Primordials.
    

### Legacy and Transition

The Cel Blindbirth Line set the stage for the **[[Line from Few|Line from Few]]**, where the surviving Huma gradually began to re-emerge from their subterranean refuges as the influence of Celia and Primordials waned. This line marked a turning point in Huma history, as they struggled to reclaim and rebuild their societies above ground, leading to the formation of new cultural and political structures.

The Cel Blindbirth Line remains a poignant reminder of the fragility of life in the Toman Ecoss and the ever-present threat posed by the forces of decay and destruction. The period is studied as both a cautionary tale and a testament to the resilience of the Huma Kingdom, which, despite near-total annihilation, managed to survive and eventually thrive in the Line from Few.
