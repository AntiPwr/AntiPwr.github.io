# Arch
_Regional Autocrat of the Chain Triarch, Anchor ([[Kleznit Advance]])_


The title of **Arch** refers to one of the three autocratic rulers who govern the [[Omep region|Omep regions]] of [[Delta]] under the [[Chain of Delta|Chain's]] regime. Each Arch is responsible for the administration, security, and enforcement of the Chain’s will within their respective region, operating with near-absolute authority but always in close alignment with the [[Medan]]. Each Arch is tailored to the unique demands of their respective region: the Arch of Kleznit fulfills the highest role of military leadership, overseeing strategy and command for the Chain’s armed forces; the Arch of Rasm directs the vast production apparatus, ensuring the relentless output of goods and materials; and the Arch of Almalek mainly focuses governance on resource extraction and population control, managing the acquisition and distribution of vital resources (with the exception of Exsolum/therium) and the birth rate to fuel society. While their methods and personalities differ, each Arch is shaped by the needs of their domain and remains united in loyalty to the Chain and its dominance across Wyldere.

## Role and Authority
The Arch is the highest authority within their Omep Region, responsible for all aspects of governance, law enforcement, and military command. They answer directly to the Medan and are expected to enforce the Chain’s policies without question.

## Relationship with the Chain Triarch
Each Arch is a member of the Chain Triarch, the ruling council of the three Omep Regions. While they may have personal rivalries or differing approaches, they are united in their service to the Chain.
