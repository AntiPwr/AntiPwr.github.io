### Feathermarks

This site utilizes AI to accumulate and formalize content, which means that the writing doesn't always have the same emotion as if a human wrote it. So, on the other side of this same statement, I am also unable to afford to put the human emotion into content that doesn't have it already, so I have to strike a balance. Truthfully, the filler content, that you may not be interested in on its own, is the same structure that allows something to be more impactful and engaging down the line. So, I decided that separating human writing from AI writing would engage the reader more. Thus, feathermarks, such as the one below, are always written by me, so you guarantee that what you are reading is given individual effort. These excerpts will speak about the most interesting sections of pages and may sometimes include poems, references to other pages, monologues, exposés, etc. They may be dramatic, comedic, or dark, may depict a set of information in nuanced ways, and ultimately will be in some way related to how I, the DM, thinks about the event. Of course, I will not be spoiling anything, but I will get you to question things if you choose to spend your time reading and learning about the world. Now, it is important to note, this doesn't mean that all other content on the page is made by AI, since I do spend a lot of time going through each heading and editing. Although, when databasing information such as this, and expecting to do it by myself, I have to focus my writing efforts on the parts that matter most. But, I also understand that to expect someone to be interested in reading information, the information has to appeal to emotion. 

Feathermarks are from the perspective of a character in the campaign named [[Corvi]] and thus they will carry his personality with them. This portion of the site is inspired by Wizards of the Coast's D&D 5e books and other TTRPG material that utilizes notes from the narrator (often, known by the title) of the book. For example Xanathar's notes to the reader are recurring and personalized through *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*. An example feathermark is below:

        How's Toma? Hm. It's funny, because I'm not really one for small talk, but asking about Toma is like asking about me. Toma's fine, alright—chillin', even. Got a few projects it's working on. All to cope with the fact that things are anything but chillin'. But if I don't <em>lie</em> to people, things could—and likely would—manifest into something much worse than I'm comfortable with. Truthfully, things are heating up pretty consistently. Just when you think, "What the fuck is wrong with this world?" it shows up and gives you one more fuck that's wrong with it.

        I realize now, just talking to you, it’s a little more like asking how the weather is—only because it carries a real example with it. You know, I could say the weather is fine too, but that turns the blindest eye to the fact that there are more natural disasters this year than last year, and the year before that, and its son… and so on. Oh, and it's all caused by a massive continental ball of wind, death, and delusion at the center of the plane. Just what I was looking for as a focal point for my politics. Looks good, no? Like a chandelier fixture… or the largest loxodon in the room.

        In fact, it's so commanding, it's maintained a name that has stood the many tests of time—tests that even it greedily defines the span of. But does it do so on a whim? Is a [[Line|line]] God's minute? Is my head spinning, or must life continuously reach past the limit? Whether chaos or order, threshold or sequence, the [[World Gyre]] lives on in the minds of Toman creatures—or at least the ones it leaves alive. It influences law without a word, pushes religion further and further from its core, and most importantly, I believe it carries a purpose that we all hope to find. A line, to me, feels like a correction process. But who could argue that point when the gods bicker just as much as we do about the true creator? 
        It makes me wonder: why is everyone dying to be correct, but will only ever die for a lie that isn’t their own? After questioning that for a while, I realized you can be dead without knowing it—and suddenly, a lot of things made sense. People are just as afraid of wasted time as they are of death, but some don’t realize it, and some realize it too much. Regardless, time remained the true problem, even when death emigrates. 
        As Donald Kingsbury wrote, “Tradition is a set of solutions for which we have forgotten the problems.” And so, might I add—even immortality has its flaws, and [[Nesa]] suffer too. Thus, when death is but yesterday’s problem, the goalpost still shifts. This new formula for death I speak of is one of willpower, and it thrives between two extremes. One extreme holds those who spend their time the wisest, and the other, those who spend it with no remorse for what they have left. 
        To both ends of the bell curve, traditional death becomes a solution—albeit in different ways. But in a world where you can no longer die, that escape is off the table. So what’s left to do but be your best, right?

        If not even the gods can figure that out, then who am I? But then again, if the God of Recruiting asked me to be among their ruling ranks, I’d surely accept. No doubt in my little [[Huma|huma]] mind. And don’t tell me that if you got the invitation, you’d say no—because, well, I wouldn’t believe you. That’s what someone who hasn’t been offered godship would say, at least. 
        Although, when I do accept, I acknowledge I wouldn’t know what I’d be jumping into. A dysfunctional family, perhaps. A corporate ladder. Another type of hierarchy maybe—that's a popular build these days. No matter their shape, let me tell you, the grass couldn’t look greener from my perspective of acceptance. I could figure it out, right? I could tip the scales. Restore balance. 
        Well, I know I’d at least do better than the last guy.
        
        And going back to the World Gyre—why else would peace be placed between cataclysms? And for what other reason would cataclysm be placed between peace? As confusing as it is, I wouldn’t worry. It wouldn’t kill everyone… right? That would be irrational. Why would it?

        It can be dangerous to apply <em>your</em> logic to the nonliving. But sometimes you have to—for your own sake. It may just be the greatest motivator we have. But be careful when you do. You might just be justifying the means to your own end.
