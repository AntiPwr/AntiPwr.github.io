### Feathermarks

This site utilizes AI to accumulate and formalize content, which means that the writing doesn't always have the same emotion as if a human wrote it. So, on the other side of this same statement, I am also unable to afford to put the human emotion into content that doesn't have it already, so I have to strike a balance. Truthfully, the filler content, that you may not be interested in on its own, is the same structure that allows something to be more impactful and engaging down the line. So, I decided that separating human writing from AI writing would engage the reader more. Thus, feathermarks, such as the one below, are always written by me, so you guarantee that what you are reading is given individual effort. These excerpts will speak about the most interesting sections of pages and may sometimes include poems, references to other pages, monologues, expos√©s, etc. They may be dramatic, comedic, or dark, may depict a set of information in nuanced ways, and ultimately will be in some way related to how I, the DM, thinks about the event. Of course, I will not be spoiling anything, but I will get you to question things if you choose to spend your time reading and learning about the world. Now, it is important to note, this doesn't mean that all other content on the page is made by AI, since I do spend a lot of time going through each heading and editing. Although, when databasing information such as this, and expecting to do it by myself, I have to focus my writing efforts on the parts that matter most. But, I also understand that to expect someone to be interested in reading information, the information has to appeal to emotion. 

Feathermarks are from the perspective of a character in the campaign named [[Corvi]] and thus they will carry his personality with them. This portion of the site is inspired by Wizards of the Coast's D&D 5e books and other TTRPG material that utilizes notes from the narrator (often, known by the title) of the book. For example Xanathar's notes to the reader are recurring and personalized through *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*. An example feathermark is below:

        How's Toma? Hm. It's funny, because I'm not really one for small talk, but asking about Toma is like asking about me. It's fine, alright, chillin' even. All to cope with the fact that things are anything but chillin', but if I don't <em>lie</em> to people, things could, and likely would, manifest much worse. Truthfully, things are heating up pretty consistently. Just when you think,
        "What the fuck is wrong with this world?",
        it shows up and provides you one more fuck that's wrong with this world.

        I realize now, just in talking to you, that it's even more like asking how the weather is. You know, I could say it's fine, but that turns the blindest eye to the fact that there are more natural disasters this year than last year, and the year before that, its son, and so on. And, oh, it's all caused by a massive continental ball of wind, death, and delusion in the center of the plane. Just what I was looking for as a center point to my politics.

        In fact, it's so powerful it was given a name that has stood the many tests of time, which, funnily enough, are defined by its own cataclysmic consequences. The consequences that accidentally lay pain upon the creatures of Toma, where its name lives on in their belief. But don't worry, it wouldn't kill everyone, right? That would be irrational. Why would it?

        It's dangerous to apply <em>your</em> logic to the nonliving, but sometimes you have to for your sake. It may just be the greatest motivator we have. But be careful, you could be justifying the means to your own end.
