# Paximaa

<img src="wiki_images/Paximaa.png"><i></i></img>

**Paximaa** is a Godan term meaning "death to all games," signifying the end of a universe and the events and consequences associated with such a profound decline. It marks the culmination of a universe's cycle and the beginning of a new phase in the endless quest for balance and understanding within the [[Omnis]]. Paximaa is deeply intertwined with the concept of [[Hollow Purpose]], reflecting the universe's failure to sustain itself and the reversal of time that follows.

## Characteristics of Paximaa

- **Universal Termination**: Paximaa marks the end of a universe's existence, where its structure and purpose collapse, leading to dissolution. It is a natural consequence of failing to achieve a stable, self-sustaining creation within the [[Scape]].
- **Symptom of Hollow Purpose**: A Paximaa occurs when the creator of a [[Bin]] fails to maintain stability, resulting in [[Hollow Purpose]] and the unraveling of the universe.
- **Temporal Reversal**: During Paximaa, time flows backward, returning to [[Mk. the Soul Engine|the Soul Engine]]. This allows for redistribution of energy and resources, enabling new attempts at creation and learning from past failures.

## Connection to Hollow Purpose

Paximaa is intrinsically linked to [[Hollow Purpose]], which signifies the instability or failure of a universe to sustain its intended trajectory. This failure stems from the creator's inability to achieve harmony between opposing forces, leading to collapse.

- **Dynamic Evolution**: The cyclical nature of Paximaa and Hollow Purpose reflects the universe's dynamic evolution, with each iteration serving as a learning experience for creators.
- **Lesson of Duality**: Understanding Paximaa provides insight into the challenges of balancing dualities, such as linearity and laterality, within creation.

## Symptoms of a Paximaa

- **Dimensional Decay**: Structural and dimensional anomalies emerge as the universe approaches Paximaa.
- **Energetic Instability**: Fluctuations in [[Crea]] and other energies indicate loss of balance and the onset of Paximaa.
- **Cosmic Dissolution**: Inhabitants may witness the unraveling of reality, with time, space, and matter losing coherence, culminating in time reversal and the universe's end.

**Paximaa** is a Godan term that mean "death to all games", or the end of the universe, encompassing the events and consequences associated with such a profound decline. It signifies the culmination of a universe's cycle and the beginning of a new phase in the endless quest for balance and understanding within the [[Omnis]]. The term is deeply intertwined with the concept of [[Hollow Purpose]], reflecting the universe's failure to sustain itself and the reversal of time that follows.

#### Characteristics of Paximaa

- **Universal Termination**: Paximaa marks the end of a universe's existence, where the structural integrity and purpose of the universe collapse, leading to its dissolution. It is a natural consequence of failing to achieve a stable, self-sustaining creation within the [[Scape]].

- **Symptom of Hollow Purpose**: A Paximaa occurs when the creator of a [[Bin]] fails to maintain stability within their universe. This results in a [[Hollow Purpose]], where the purpose driving creation becomes untenable, causing the universe to unravel and time to reverse.

- **Temporal Reversal**: During a Paximaa, time flows backward, returning to the [[Mk. the Soul Engine]]. This process allows for a redistribution of energy and resources, enabling the creators of the [[Scape]] and [[Scape (TTRPG)/Other Side]] to attempt new creations and learn from their previous failures.


#### Connection to Hollow Purpose

Paximaa is intrinsically linked to the concept of Hollow Purpose, which signifies the instability or failure of a universe to sustain its intended trajectory. This failure stems from the creator's inability to achieve a harmonious balance between opposing forces or elements within their creation, leading to the collapse of purpose and structure.

- **Dynamic Evolution**: The cyclical nature of Paximaa and Hollow Purpose reflects the universe's dynamic evolution, where each iteration serves as a learning experience for creators, pushing them toward the ultimate goal of creating a universe that can exist indefinitely without collapse.

- **Lesson of Duality**: By understanding the causes and consequences of Paximaa, creators and inhabitants alike gain insight into the challenges of balancing dualities, such as linearity and laterality, within their creations.


#### Symptoms of a Paximaa

- **Dimensional Decay**: As a universe approaches Paximaa, signs of decay become evident, with structural and dimensional anomalies emerging across the [[Scape]].

- **Energetic Instability**: Fluctuations in [[Crea]] and other fundamental energies indicate the loss of balance within the universe, heralding the onset of Paximaa.

- **Cosmic Dissolution**: The universe's inhabitants may witness the unraveling of reality, where time, space, and matter lose coherence, culminating in the reversal of time and the universe's end.
