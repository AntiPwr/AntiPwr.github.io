# Rite of Recomposition

<img src="wiki_images/Rite_of_Recomposition.png"><i></i></img>

The Rite of Recomposition is a [[Rites of Huma|Rite of Huma]] that establishes the relationship between death, renewal, and technological evolution. It originates from the Reins of Alwa, a myth that emphasizes repurposing the remains of the past to construct the future. This rite serves as both a spiritual principle and a practical necessity, guiding the development of synthetic decomposition technologies in [[Sol Unita]] and reinforcing the idea that all things must decay and be reshaped to achieve progress.

## Historical Context

The Rite of Recomposition emerged following the banishment of the [[Celia]] kingdom from Sol Unita. The Celia, known for their natural ability to break down organic matter, were once responsible for maintaining the cycle of decomposition. However, religious doctrine and resource control led to their removal, forcing Sol Unita to develop alternative methods to sustain the cycle of life.

This rite was formalized as a justification for the use of technology to replace the Celia's function, ensuring that the breakdown and recycling of organic material remained uninterrupted. In doing so, Sol Unita reinforced its belief that human ingenuity and faith were superior to relying on natural, uncontrolled processes.

## Technological Recomposition

The Rite of Recomposition legitimized synthetic decomposition technologies, allowing Sol Unita to replace natural decay with engineered alternatives. These technologies include:

- Hollow resource processing, where organic waste is transformed into energy-efficient materials used in infrastructure and manufacturing.
- Synthetic fungal growths, engineered organisms that mimic decomposition without the risk of uncontrolled spread.
- Resonance-based recycling, a process using [[Spira]]-enhanced vibrations to break down materials at a molecular level.

Through these innovations, Sol Unita ensured that the cycle of life could be maintained without Celia interference, reinforcing its belief in controlled progress.

## Philosophical and Cultural Significance

Beyond its technological applications, the Rite of Recomposition is a philosophical framework that applies to knowledge, beliefs, and governance. It teaches that:

- Ideas must decay and reform naturally so that new and improved concepts can emerge.
- Society must be in constant renewal, as the past serves as a foundation but should never restrict progress.
- Death is a transformation, not an end, reinforcing the Asceptim belief that the soul’s energy contributes to a greater cycle.

This ideology is reflected in governance, where leaders and policies are constantly reevaluated. It is also deeply embedded in education, where knowledge is expected to evolve rather than remain static.

## Legacy and Influence

The Rite of Recomposition remains one of the most transformative rites within Sol Unita, influencing technology, faith, and governance. It ensures that the past is never discarded but always repurposed, shaping everything from industrial policies to spiritual practices.

While the rejection of Celia has led to significant technological advancements, it has also sparked debates about whether the decision was necessary or if it was motivated more by political control than religious doctrine. However, as long as Sol Unita thrives, the Rite of Recomposition will continue to justify humanity’s role in shaping the world rather than being shaped by it.

# Implementation

- In Scender Proper, it is illegal to use the word “Precedent” in referal to Alwa, as it is a statement on creature’s ascension rather than death to the Scepitath.
- Fear of the consequences of the Rite of Recomposition leads to a Monstra-Celia resonant to exist called a [[Bubbler]]. This is the fear of Asceptim religious consequence for consuming yeast-based alcohol.
