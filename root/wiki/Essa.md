The **Essa** is the final and most personal quantized taxon in [[Purpose Taxonomy]], representing the unique soul, purpose, and destiny of an individual within the universe. Essa is the realization and understanding of one's own [[Crea]]—the fundamental core of biological expression and the idealized expression of a soul's purpose. To know one's Essa is to know one's true place and contribution to the evolution and balance of existence.

## What is Essa?

Essa is the individual's soul—an expression of personality, purpose, and the essence of creation. It is the culmination of all other taxons, distilled into a singular, meaningful identity. In the philosophy of Purpose Taxonomy, the ultimate goal is to discover and articulate one's Essa, distinguishing it from all others.

- **Individual Destiny:** Essa defines the unique contribution each being makes to the universe's evolution and balance.
- **Crea as Core:** At the heart of every Essa is the [[Crea]], the metaphysical engine that binds time, memory, and willpower to existence.
- **Self-Realization:** To find one's Essa is to achieve self-understanding and to know one's true purpose, no matter the current reality.

Essa or [[Crea]] is the individual's [[Soul Anatomy]], or ultimately the full understanding of oneself. Crea is the essence of you.

Aristotelian Essence

Essa is the understanding of one's own Crea, including fate

Defines the individual's purpose or destiny and essence of creation representing their unique contribution to the universe's evolution and balance. if there is existence, then a person must fit somewhere in that existence in an individual manner. Essa

“You exist,




Essa is based upon personality and purpose of creation. Essa is the goal of purpose taxonomy and serves as the final taxon that can be described by a few words that carry the weight of plethoric meaning.




Essa, by some, is thought of as a collective energy that is born or created by the components of a faith, such as in Sol Unita. Essa, by others, is thought of as an individual's purpose in disregard to other lifeforms and their supposed purpose, such as in the Chain of Delta. This taxon is the largest academic point of contention between the Toman classes.
