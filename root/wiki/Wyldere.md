Parallel to the northern shelf is the [[Summons Mountain Range]].




[[Vokar]]

[[Sable]] means to be albino, but instead of white and red it is black and purple. It is the opposite of being albino in the Toman Ecoss. Sable can also refer to the [[Sable Mountain Range]], often called the Sable Region by outsiders. [[Sable (Term)]] wiki page should be for the word, but the [[Sable]] page should reference that it can mean two things. 

The Sable Mountains are slanted and made of dark stone. The area is rich in minerals and ores, rain, hardy forests, vast lakes. This area is inspired by a mix between the Howling Fjord

[[Velspir]] (named by a group of Usakan migrants that do not believe in subjectivism for society. These settlers created the Candleflame Coalition, Essenex, and Vindau on Wyldere early in the [[Current Line]]. These setters immensely benefitted from natural resources and trade with local settlements. They especially benefitted from the weakness of the [[Branches of Concordia]] government following the [[War of Conclusions]] with [[Scender Unita]]. Domestically, in [[Concordia]], there was a desire for alliances to aid societal growth following the lost war. [[Lahsom]] [[Henrir Kelleric]]  (leader of the Branches at the time) disagreed with this notion and society broke out into riots. This dissent, which had risen into rebellion due to many events that had occurred in Concordia since the growth of the Branches as a continental civilization, had formed into a political party called the Seos Ofshut which challenged the Leiflan Ofshut and Lahsom Kelleric. Prior to this there were other Ofshuts, but they lacked organization and willingness to compete with the crown. The War of Conclusions, however, proved to the domestic populations in Concordia that new leadership was necessary for survival, especially given the fact that the next Gyre Shift would almost certainly tectonically thrust Concordia off the [[Shelf|shelf]]  These Usakan migrants also caused the eternal rain, previously mentioned, over [[Vindau]] following a foreign relations mishap with Natura elementals in the region.)

[[Anapore]] is the rainy subregion of the Sable Mountain Range where Vindau is located (mountain valley).




This is a section from the [[World Gyre]] which has to do with mountains in general, but especially on Wyldere. Wyldere has drastic elevation increases, but is generally quite flat outside the northern Summons Mountain Range line across the continent. Most mountains are angled mountains due to the World Gyre's rotation pushing tectonic plates outward (whether clockwise or counter-clockwise). [[Angled Mountain]] is a natural phenomenon in Toma.

# Populations of Wyldere
- [[Gov'Doran]] is capital order of [[Yevnijn Tres]]. 
- [[Chain of Delta]], [[Delta]]
- [[Tildohsi Partition]], [[Tildohsi]]
- [[Candleflame Coalition]], [[Essenex]]
- [[Nanuruk]], [[Vokari Centaur]], [[Rukrije]]

Rukrije is an order in North Vokar[[is (term)]] includes a single angled mountain overlook called [[Rohmunt]], and its valley is called [[Soffweaden]]

When a region's name in Wyldere ends with an "-is" this means that it is referring to the the piece of the region that nears the Summons Mountain Range, which most commonly is to the north of each of Wyldere's regions. For example, Vokaris is the northern portion of Vokar, which is near the Summons Mountain Range, which spans the northern perimeter of the plane's [[Shelf|shelf]].

Rukrije is ruled by the [[Nanuruk]]

[[Vokari Centaur]]














Environmental Aesthetics of Sable and Vokar in Wyldere
Sable Region (Wyldere)


Sable’s southern coast is reminiscent of a Nordic fjord, with ocean inlets cutting deep into the land. Towering cliffs rise sharply from the sea, forming a coastline of treacherous rock walls, dark evergreen forests, and narrow plains atop the bluffs

. The climate here is cool and maritime – damp sea winds race in from offshore, producing a near-constant eerie howl as they whip through the fjords and valleys

. Hardy spruce and pine trees cling to the cliff edges, and waterfalls fed by coastal rains plunge into turquoise fjord waters below. In one dramatic location, an ancient timber lift carries travelers up the sheer cliffside, echoing the Howling Fjord’s famous lift from sea level to high plateau. Despite the rugged terrain, the southernmost terraces of Sable are surprisingly fertile: pockets of flatter ground hold thin soil where settlers cultivate hardy grains and vegetables, benefitting from milder temperatures and frequent misty rain. Wildlife such as mountain goats and bears navigate the crags, while seabirds nest on ledges above the surf. Overall, Sable’s south exudes a wild, windswept beauty – a fjordland of steep granite walls and misty conifer woods balanced by pockets of gentle meadow on the highlands. 

As one travels north in Sable, the environment shifts toward windswept tundra and enchanted autumnal woods. The region known as Sabelis (northern Sable) borders the mighty Summons Mountain Range and endures a harsher climate. Much of Sabelis is a flat, glacial plateau devoid of dense vegetation, dotted only with rimy grasses and low scrub on permafrost

. In the brief summer, the tundra floor comes alive with wildflowers and lichens; by autumn it transforms into a landscape of red and gold, as if cloaked in eternal autumn

. Stands of hardy birch and larch trees (their leaves blazing orange and crimson) line certain sheltered valleys and coastal stretches, evoking the vibrant foliage of Azshara’s endless fall. Nearer the northern coast, great craggy cliffs and broad beaches meet an icy sea

, providing dramatic vistas where golden woods overlook steel-gray waters. As Sabelis approaches the Summons Range, the terrain becomes rockier and rises in elevation. The air grows thin and brutally cold. Here the tundra offers little cover – the fierce wind can tear across the plains with startling force, making it hard to even hear one’s own shout

. Only a few gnarled evergreen shrubs and mosses manage to survive in cracks of frost-shattered rock

. Summons Mountain Range itself forms a looming wall on Sabelis’s horizon: jagged peaks coated in snow and ice year-round. These mountains were forged by powerful tectonic forces (the Dance of Spira) and thrust upward at steep angles, giving them a dramatic, almost otherworldly profile. The lower slopes are treacherous scree and glaciers, and avalanches are common. Locals wisely avoid venturing too far north, as Sabelis fades into the deadly heights of Summons, where blizzards howl and nothing human can easily survive. Overall, Sable’s northern reaches present a striking contrast: from the fiery autumn forests near the coast to the bleak, wind-scoured tundra and the razor-edged mountains beyond, Sabelis embodies both ethereal beauty and formidable harshness.
Vokar Region (Wyldere)


Vokar’s southern expanse unfolds into a vast river delta known as the “Chain of Delta,” a fertile flatland shaped by the sea. Unlike Sable’s steep shores, southern Vokar is predominantly low-lying and marshy, where countless braided river channels push inland from the ocean. The World Gyre’s immense currents drive saltwater rivers here far upriver, carving winding paths through the soil. These rivers snake in S-curves across the plains, never freezing even in the depth of winter thanks to their salinity (seawater freezes at a lower temperature than fresh water

). In spring and summer, the delta is a tableau of lush green wetlands and grassy meadows between shining waterways. Emerald reed-beds and wildflowers flourish on the banks, and the land is nourished by mineral-rich silt from seasonal flooding. You might imagine scenes akin to a grand European delta or the Alpine foothills in spring: blooming fields and pastures threaded by sparkling streams, all backdropped by distant snow-capped peaks. The climate here is markedly seasonal. Summers are mild and bountiful – farmers of the Chain of Delta grow ample crops on the well-watered plains, and herds graze on thriving grasses. Warm breezes from the south (driven by the outward-flowing wind patterns of the Gyre) keep the air moving, and afternoon thunderstorms are common, replenishing the delta. In autumn the delta remains green well after inland areas have frosted over, due to the thermal inertia of the surrounding saltwater. Winters, however, are long and challenging. Most of Vokar’s landscape freezes under snow and hoarfrost; blizzards sweep across the open flats. Yet, remarkably, the delta rivers continue to flow freely all winter – their salty waters resist freezing, often running dark and fast while the fields around lie under a white blanket. This unique circumstance is life-saving for the inhabitants: the Chain of Delta civilization relies on year-round navigation and fishing in these unfrozen channels. On especially cold mornings, one can see mist rising from the warmer river surfaces against the snowy banks. The delta’s wetlands also attract wildlife; waterfowl flock to open water, and delta foxes and lynxes hunt along the frozen reed margins. All told, southern Vokar in fair seasons is vibrant and abundant, a striking contrast to the icy slumber it falls into each winter. The land’s continual rebirth each spring – fed by ocean currents and protected by salt rivers – makes it one of the most fertile regions on Wyldere. 

As one travels north through Vokar, the gentle delta gives way to harsher, alpine terrain and ultimately the unforgiving Summons Range. The central and northern parts of Vokar (often called Vokaris) rise gradually in elevation. Rolling flatlands turn to foothills, then to sharp mountain inclines as you approach the continent’s rim. In these middle latitudes, Vokar enjoys a brief but beautiful spring: valleys bloom with alpine flowers and birch groves, and crystal-clear rivers (both salt and fresh tributaries) cascade down from the highlands. However, even in early autumn, frosts reappear and the foliage is often dusted with snow. By the time one reaches Vokaris proper, winter conditions dominate much of the year. The far north of Vokar endures arctic cold similar to Sabelis – permafrost earth with patches of stunted tundra vegetation and ice. The approach to the Summons Mountain Range is marked by increasingly steep, jagged cliffs and escarpments

. Here the terrain seems to rise suddenly like a wall: enormous black-rock mountains streaked with permanent snowfields. The Summons Range along Vokar’s border is higher and more massive than anywhere else, with peaks thrusting into the sky as if reaching for the aurora. The upper elevations are an alien world of stone and ice – the ground is solid glacier in many places, with no soil or plant life at all

. Blinding sunlight reflects off endless ice sheets on clear days, while in foul weather, sleet and freezing gales batter the slopes

. Travelers attempting the passes face deadly hazards: howling winds that can pluck a person off a ridge, and sudden avalanches crashing down the chutes. Even the sunlight can be perilous, with the glare off the ice capable of snow-blinding unwary eyes

. Virtually nothing grows in this extreme northern subregion – at most a rare tuft of brown grass or a lichen-covered rock amid expanses of glacial till

. Despite the desolation, the scenery is awe-inspiring: turquoise glacial lakes lie at the feet of towering ice-clad cliffs (as in the image above), and the air is eerily clear. During the height of winter, Vokaris and the Summons are engulfed in darkness and blizzards. All of Wyldere freezes as far south as the mid-continent in the worst years – occasionally even Sable’s southern coast sees snow – but Vokar’s salt rivers keep flowing, carving through ice fields and reminding one of the ocean’s persistent influence. In sum, northern Vokar is a land of stark contrasts. It begins with green foothills and crisp rivers, transitions into a realm of snowy forests and bare rock in the alpine zone, and ends at the monumental Summons Range – a razor-edged barrier of ice where the world seemingly ends. Both Sable and Vokar find their ultimate northern limits in those peaks, reinforcing the idea that Wyldere’s northern perimeter is as beautiful as it is deadly, shaped by both natural climate and the mystical geology of the World Gyre.
