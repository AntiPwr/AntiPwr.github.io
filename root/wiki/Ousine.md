# Ousine

<img src="wiki_images/Ousine.png"><i></i></img>

The **Ousine** is a homebrew D&D 5e race that blends the keen senses and silent flight of the owl with the formidable strength and presence of the bear, shaped by the essence of [[Huma]]. Each Ousine is either an [[Anthros]]—upright and intelligent, but still largely animal in nature—or a [[Zothros]]—mostly Huma, but evolving toward a more feral, animalistic form. On average, Anthros are bipedal and display more cultural adaptability, though some may move on all fours or exhibit more animalistic behaviors. Zothros, conversely, are more often quadrupedal and instinct-driven, but many can walk upright and possess a strong sense of self and society. Whether stalking the night on silent wings or standing as guardians of the wild, Ousine embody the balance between wisdom, ferocity, and the mysteries of the natural world.

## Form and Resonance
When you create an Ousine character, choose your form and resonant alignment. This choice does not alter your core traits—only one secondary benefit (see **Resonance Benefit**).

- **Anthros (Huma-leaning):**  
  Often bipedal or upright, anthropomorphic form with heightened intellect and cultural adaptability.
- **Zothros (Ferra-leaning):**  
  Bestial, zoomorphic form—powerful, instinct-driven, often moving on all fours or crouched low.

## Racial Traits
- **Ability Score Increase.** You can choose either:  
  - +2 to one ability score and +1 to a different score, **or**  
  - +1 to three different ability scores.  
  You can’t raise any score above 20.
- **Size.** Medium. Anthros stand 5–8 ft tall; Zothros measure 3–6 ft at the shoulder.
- **Speed.**  
  - Walking: 30 ft  
- **Darkvision.** See in dim light within 60 ft as bright light, in darkness as dim light (shades of gray only).
- **Silent Leap.** When you make a long or high jump, you land silently. If you land within 5 ft of one or more creatures, each must succeed on a DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier or be pushed 5 ft away and knocked prone. You take no falling damage from your own jump.
- **Natural Weapons.** Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 + your Strength modifier slashing damage (claws). You may flavor critical hits as a beak (piercing) strike if you wish (applicable when using [[Critical Hits Revisited]]).
- **Powerful Build.** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.
- **Beast Speech.** Through body language, hoots, and growls, you can communicate simple ideas to owls, bears, and owlbears. You have advantage on Charisma (Animal Handling) checks to influence owls or bears.
- **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common.  

## Resonance Benefit
Choose one when you build your character:

- **Anthros (Huma-leaning):**  
  Gain proficiency in one tool or one skill of your choice and learn one additional language of your choice.
- **Zothros (Ferra-leaning):**  
  You have advantage on all Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on hearing or smell.
