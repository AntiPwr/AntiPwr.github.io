The Automata [[Kingdom]] represents a unique blend of technology and spirituality within the [[Toman Ecoss]], distinguished from other kingdoms by their origin from [[Therium]], a [[Hollow Resource|Hollow Resource]]. Unlike other kingdoms created by [[Zlellis and O'nume]], the Automata were crafted by the hands of [[Huma]], embodying the ingenuity and creativity of their makers.

### Origin

The Automata arose from the Huma's technological advancements and the discovery of Therium. As a kingdom not directly crafted by Zero and One, the Automata hold a unique position within the Toman Ecoss, representing the potential of creation through belief and technology rather than divine intervention.

### Construction

Automatons are constructed, not born, requiring a vessel to house [[Therium]] of some sort. These vessels vary widely in form and function, often designed to enhance locomotion, perception, and anima circulation, but any structure capable of holding a Therium core can serve as a vessel. The process of constructing an Automata involves careful crafting and infusion of belief, allowing the vessel to become a sentient being.

### Therium Core

The core of every Automaton is made of refined Therium, allowing for the storage and generation of belief. With the right vessel, an Automata can generate its own belief through anima-powered mechanical perception, mimicking biological senses. The Therium core functions as the brain of the Automaton, and when sealed to reject new beliefs, it allows can restrict the Automata's free will, creating a distinguishment between [[Willed-Mecha]] and [[Free-Mecha]].

### Fate Worse than Death

Automata face a unique vulnerability: their Therium core must remain intact to preserve consciousness. If the vessel is destroyed or separated from its core, the Automata loses all senses but retains consciousness and memories, leading to a potential eternity of paralysis without a new vessel. This represents a fate worse than death for an Automaton, trapped within its own thoughts.
