**Bin**: [[Scape]]

**Eco**: [[Scape (TTRPG)/1 Purpose Taxonomy/Complete Taxonomy/02 Eco/01 Toman Ecoss/02 Toma/Toma]] of [[Toman Ecoss]]

The Spawn of Hidraal, also known as the Hoardskaan, are the three surviving primordial serpents that were born from the beheaded hydra, **[[Hidraal]]**. These serpents are among the most feared and powerful creatures within the Toman Ecoss, each embodying a distinct aspect of their mother’s legacy and power. The Spawn of Hidraal are manifestations of raw, untamed, and often destructive forces of nature, each carrying a part of Hidraal's immense and twisted might.

### Behidraspaan

- [[Lopali]]
- [[Kautiger]]
- [[Qa'ura]]
- [[Hathakrik]]

### Legacy and Influence

The Spawn of Hidraal continue to roam the Toman Ecoss, each pursuing its own twisted version of their mother’s legacy. Lopali, Attiger, and Qa'ura remain in Toma, while Hathakrik, the regrown body of Hidraal, lurks in Dar. Their existence is a constant threat to the balance of power within the Toman Ecoss, particularly for the current ruling forces of Apex and Praeda. Should these serpents ever reunite, their combined strength could rekindle the ancient conflicts that once ravaged the world, leading to a new era of chaos and hoarding.
