<!-- ## Characteristics of Imaa as a Planar Event
Imaa marks the point where a plane undergoes significant changes as it approaches its end. This transformation is often accompanied by heightened activity, conflicts, or natural phenomena that reflect the plane's inherent themes and challenges. During Imaa, the forces within a plane reach their peak, pushing the boundaries of stability. This extremism can manifest as intensified weather, increased magical activity, or dramatic shifts in the ecosystem. Ultimately, Imaa is the culmination of forces and entities within the plane, leading to a climax that drives the plane toward its resolution and highlights its core dynamics and conflicts.

<!-- ## Role of Imaa in the Universe

Imaa acts as a clear sign of an impending shift within the Omnis, signaling that a plane is nearing its end and preparing for transformation or dissolution. The intensity of Imaa propels the plane and its inhabitants toward adaptation and change, fostering resilience and evolution in response to the approaching conclusion. By amplifying the themes and conflicts that define the plane, Imaa offers insight into the broader dynamics at play within the universe and highlights the interconnectedness of all planes.

<!-- ## Related Concepts

- [[Soul Imaa]]: Imaa can also apply to souls, indicating a state of extremism and transformation in a soul's journey.
- [[Holoscape|Hollow Purpose]]: Imaa is similar to the Holoscape, which marks the death or transformation of a bin within the Scape.
