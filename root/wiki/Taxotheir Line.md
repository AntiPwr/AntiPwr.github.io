**Bin**: [[Scape]]  
**Basin**: [[Sacrus]]  
**Eco**: [[Scape (TTRPG)/1 Purpose Taxonomy/Complete Taxonomy/02 Eco/01 Toman Ecoss/02 Toma/Toma]] of [[Toman Ecoss]]  
**Kingdom**: [[Huma]]

The **Taxotheir Line** is a significant era in the history of the Toman Ecoss, marked by the formation of early governance structures and the beginning of organized warfare over **[[Hollow Resource]]**. This period laid the groundwork for the complex political, social, and economic systems that would evolve in later lines, particularly those tied to the **[[Purpose Taxonomy]]**. The Taxotheir Line was characterized by intense conflict, resource scarcity, and the emergence of powerful factions that would shape the future of the Huma Kingdom.

### Overview

The Taxotheir Line began following the **[[Line from Maturation]]**, a time when Huma and Monstra first emerged as dominant forces in Toma. As these civilizations developed, so too did their needs and ambitions, leading to the discovery and exploitation of Hollow Resources. These resources became the catalyst for widespread conflict, as factions vied for control over the limited and highly sought-after materials that were essential for survival and technological advancement.

### The Role of Hollow Resources

Hollow Resources were unique materials with properties that could influence the natural and spiritual realms, making them invaluable to the emerging societies. Control over these resources meant power, and thus, the Taxotheir Line was defined by relentless warfare as factions sought to dominate the supply. The struggle over Hollow Resources led to the first formations of Purpose Taxonomy, as societies began to organize themselves around the roles and functions necessary to acquire, process, and defend these vital materials.

### Major Factions: Esterik and Scepitath

Two of the most influential factions during the Taxotheir Line were the **[[Esterik]]** and the **[[Scepitath]]** (later known as the Presceptists). Both played pivotal roles in the conflicts of this era, each developing distinct philosophies and methods of governance that would have lasting impacts on the Toman Ecoss.

- **Esterik**: The Esterik were one of the first to understand the deeper workings of the **[[Rite of Passage]]**, a sacred artifact created by the Goda, which they studied and used to gain an advantage in their conflicts. Their mastery of the Rite allowed them to harness the power of Hollow Resources more effectively, making them a formidable force during the Taxotheir Line. However, their dominance would be challenged by the Scepitath.
    
- **Scepitath (Presceptists)**: The Scepitath, known in later lines as the Presceptists, emerged as the principal rivals to the Esterik. They too learned to use Ester Slates and other artifacts, developing their own methods for controlling Hollow Resources. The Scepitath were proponents of a more organized and philosophical approach to warfare and governance, setting the stage for the eventual development of **[[Asceptim]]** and the founding of Sol Unita in the **[[Line from Few]]**.
    

### End of the Taxotheir Line

The Taxotheir Line came to an end due to a pivotal shift in the World Gyre, also known as the **[[Dance of Spira]]**. This rotation change signaled the transition to the **[[Cel Blindbirth Line|Cel Blindbirth Line]]**, as the balance of power shifted and new threats, particularly from the **[[Celia]]** and **[[Primordial|Primordials]]**, began to emerge. The conflicts of the Taxotheir Line had depleted the resources and strength of the warring factions, leading to widespread devastation and setting the stage for the horrors of the Cel Blindbirth Line.

### Legacy

The legacy of the Taxotheir Line is one of both innovation and destruction. It was during this period that the foundational structures of Purpose Taxonomy were established, and the first major civilizations of the Huma Kingdom began to take shape. However, the relentless pursuit of Hollow Resources also sowed the seeds of future calamities, as the world was plunged into chaos and decay during the Cel Blindbirth Line.

The Taxotheir Line remains a critical era for understanding the evolution of the Toman Ecoss, providing key insights into the rise and fall of early Huma societies and the cyclical nature of the Dance of Spira.
