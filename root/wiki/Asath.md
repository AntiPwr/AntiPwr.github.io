Asath, also known as the Eye, is a [[Nesa]] worshipped by the followers of the [[Asceptim]] phylum. Asath is not a considered a living deity but rather a celestial ever-present energy felt as a growing pleasure and warmth. The [[Rite of Passage]], an ancient religious relic, plays a foundational role in Asceptim belief, embedding Asath as the ultimate symbol of enlightenment and ascension out from the material realm.

## Appearance and Symbolism

Asath is depicted as a radiant sun, often illustrated in sacred texts and architectural designs as a burning fractal, representing the infinite layers of knowledge and light he so kindly provides. During shortstars, Asath’s appearance in the sky becomes an event of divine importance, as his fractaled rays intensify, reinforcing his image as an all-seeing, ever-guiding force, before fading away quickly. Conversely, during Longstars, Asath's sunfade is described as a long, romantic play of nature's artistry. 

In Asceptim philosophy, Asath’s eye is always open, watching over those who seek enlightenment. This belief manifests in rituals like the [[Ceremony of His Eye]], where chosen followers undergo ritualistic blinding, symbolizing a submission to divine knowledge. The lack of pain associated with Asath’s heat further solidifies its role as an omnibenevolent presence—offering warmth, but never discomfort.

## Role in Asceptim

Asath is central to the spiritual and philosophical framework of Asceptim. It is considered the source of life and guidance, the beacon that illuminates the path toward ascension. Followers believe that Asath’s light is a divine conduit, revealing truths that would otherwise remain obscured.

The [[Rite of Passage]] specifically establishes Asath as the primary step toward total enlightenment, portraying the sun as an entity whose presence is necessary for growth, both physical and spiritual.
