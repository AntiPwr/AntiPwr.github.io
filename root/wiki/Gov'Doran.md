**Gov'Doran** is an Order (city) located in the northeast plains of Wyldere, south of the East [[Summons Mountain Range]] in the region known as [[Roknor]]. The city is governed by the Class [[Yevnijn Tres]] and is renowned for its delicate societal balance between [[Primalism and Advancism]]. The population is primarily composed of [[Anthros]] and [[Zothros]], with a social structure that divides individuals into predators (decision makers) and prey (the general populace). This dynamic creates ongoing tension and debate, especially as the youth push for change and challenge traditional roles.

Gov'Doran is famous for its vibrant betting and fighting scene, particularly the traditional martial competition known as [[Snofut]]. In Snofut, competitors engage in 1v1 unclothed fights to the death in snowy arenas, with strict rules on striking and grappling. The event is a test of torque, power, and resilience, and its most serious fighters are highly respected. The city also hosts relay races and tag-based matches, further emphasizing the predator-prey dynamic.

The people of Gov'Doran are known for their resilience, humor, and strong sense of community, forged through constant warfare and hardship. Military service is highly respected, and the city’s education system is designed to produce fit, intelligent, and tactical citizens. Artistic expression, especially comedy, is valued as a coping mechanism, and free speech is a core cultural tenet. Despite a tradition of feigned liberty, Gov'Doran ultimately remains under the influence of the [[Chain of Delta]], except for the [[Sable Mountain Range|Sable Region]].

The city’s society is currently polarized by the competing ideologies of Primalism and Advancism, with the population divided over the direction of future change. This tension is reflected in all aspects of life, from politics to daily interactions, making Gov'Doran a dynamic and ever-evolving city.

Essentially, it is a 1v1 unclothed fight to the death in a snowy environment, where you can't throw any strikes or kicks on the inside of the body. This means all attacks must come from the left or right of the individual. The only exception is if a hand is touching the ground, you can throw a kick in any direction. All attacks must come from the left or right. Grappling can occur at any time and punches can be thrown on the ground. The fighters have an incredible use of torque and power, being able to change direction with ease through momentum. You may not poke the eyes, bite, but you may headbutt, and hit in the groin. For this reason, many serious fighters get castrated. These fighters are extremely battle hardened and respected.

Snofut has two types of competitors, predator or prey. In a predator vs predator match, it is a 1v1 duel as mentioned. In a prey vs prey match, it is a relay race. In a predator vs. prey match, it is a game of tag where the predator has to try and catch the prey and bring him into submission, there is no striking in this event, only grappling.
