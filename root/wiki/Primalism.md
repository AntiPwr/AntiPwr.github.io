# Primalism

<img src="Primalism.png"><i></i></img>

Primalism is a belief system thought to be naturally derived from the resonance of [[Huma]] and [[Ferra]], focused on a return to primal ways, directly opposing [[Advancism]]. This belief is typically held by [[Zothros]] species, influenced heavily by the direction that resonance brought them in, in terms of the progression of intelligence.

## Resonance and the Spectrum of Evolution

Primalism, like Advancism, is shaped by the resonance between Huma and Ferra. However, Primalists are more conservative, retaining a deep connection to nature and ancestral ways. This conservatism is not staticâ€”creatures with strong resonance experience conscious, subconscious, physical, and mental evolutions, adapting to their environment and the needs of their community. The direction of resonance (evolution with other kingdoms) greatly influences ideology. A Huma that evolves to have more Ferra traits (becoming a [[Zothros]]) tends toward primalist ideology, valuing instinct, tradition, and harmony with the wild. A Ferra that evolves to have more Huma traits (becoming an [[Anthros]]) is more likely to adopt advancist beliefs. Thus, Primalism and Advancism exist on a spectrum, with many creatures and cultures falling somewhere in between, shaped by their evolutionary journey and the kingdoms they resonate with.

## Ideological Traits

Primalists argue that intellectual complexity can lead to greater experiential suffering, often concerned with the development of ideology, war, and the existential threat known as the [[Fear of the Fall|Fall]]. The Fall is the fear of a return to anarchy and a state of mind incapable of inner peace. Primalists believe that by returning the soul to nature, one can achieve wholeness and be considered for reincarnation. Primalists value tradition, instinct, and the wisdom of the wild, emphasizing living in harmony with nature and the cycles of life. They are wary of unchecked technological or societal advancement, but adapt and evolve in ways that reinforce their connection to the natural world.

While Primalism is often contrasted with Advancism, it is not a rejection of advancement itself. Rather, Primalists value evolution based on instinct and the enhancement of their abilities through natural selection and adaptation. Advancement is achieved not through societal or technological progress, but through the development of powerful evolutionary traits, finding and mastering a niche, and relying on the strengths passed down from ancestors. Primalists may use limited technology, but their focus is on survival, resilience, and thriving within the bounds of nature. Their progress is measured by their ability to adapt, endure, and excel in their environment, rather than by the complexity of their societies or inventions.

## Interconnections and Subphylums

Primalism is not isolated; it has many subphylums and shares traits with other ideologies. There are overlaps and exchanges with advancist societies, especially in regions where Huma and Ferra populations intermingle. Primalist communities may also adopt certain tools or practices from advancist neighbors, but always with the intent of preserving their core values.
