Lopali is a sleek and agile creature, known as the Serpent Ray. This Ferra and Water Natura serpent moves with the grace and fluidity of a ray, capable of gliding through both water and air. Lopali embodies the adaptability and fluidity of nature, a creature at home in the vast oceans and open skies of the Toman Ecoss.
