## Open Market and Trade Periods

Estal Link features an open market accessible only to those with citizenship in the Chain of Delta, marked by [[Okog]] photometal implants that bind individuals to the state and suppress their free speech. This market is the sole gateway for Delta’s international trade, with strict regulations ensuring that only state-approved goods are exported or imported. Estal Link opens to global trade during specific times of the year, usually for a four-month period, during which Delta presents itself as a prosperous and well-ordered city. After the trade period ends, Estal closes to outsiders, and the true conditions of Delta remain hidden.

## Economic Control and Social Engineering

The wealth and resources of Estal Link are heavily guarded and controlled by the government, ensuring that the elite of Delta benefit from the city’s trade while the rest of the population remains in poverty. The region’s carefully curated image of prosperity is part of a broader strategy of social engineering, where the illusion of wealth and success is used to mask the corruption and exploitation that sustain Delta’s economy.

## Estalfolk and Okogs

Estalfolk are the people from Estal Link, distinguished by their [[Okog]] photometal implants. These implants serve as both a mark of citizenship and a tool of control, binding individuals to the state and regulating their participation in trade and public life.
