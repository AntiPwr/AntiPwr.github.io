Kautiger, also known as Usakan Hoardskaan or the Oedipwyrm, is a Ferra and Ground Natura wyrm with influences from Celia. This multi-headed wyrm is psychotic, driven to madness by the abuse it suffered from its siblings. Kautigerâ€™s form is twisted and grotesque, with numerous appendage heads equipped with claws that allow it to burrow through the earth. It uses its Celia abilities to digest rock and transform it into soil, essential for the decay and rebirth cycles of nature.

Clay creature

Clay mixer society, potmakers, etc. They make pots they fill with substances. they all eat the same slop, [[Moluk]], made from Kautiger's clay. This society works alongside Kautiger.

Moluk is exported to the Chain of Delta and is a very popular, cheap drug. [[Clath]] is the Natura Imaan Plane of potmakers.
