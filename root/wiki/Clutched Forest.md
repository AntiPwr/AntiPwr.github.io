<!--A lamen (Latin, meaning "plate") is a magical pendant used as a protective 'magical breastplate' worn around the neck so that it hangs upon the breast over the heart.[1] Its uses vary but, most commonly, the term refers to a symbol of authority and a focus of magical energies. Lamen Huxt embodies this idea of protection as a Wylderan lonesome traveler and writer.-->

The **Clutched Forest** is a vast, forested region located in Middle [[Wyldere]] on the southern coast of [[Toma]]. Known for its unique blend of freshwater from the Summons Mountain Range and saltwater rivers pushing into the continent from the [[Swirling Sea]], the Clutched Forest is a land of remarkable ecological diversity and abundance. Saltwater rivers, fed by the powerful currents of the [[World Gyre]], wind through the dense woodlands, enriching the soil and supporting a wide array of plant and animal life. The forest’s resources and strategic location have made it a focal point for settlement, trade, and conflict throughout the history of the region.

The largest organized population in the Clutched Forest is the [[Tildohsi Partition]] (140,000 HR), whose capital city, [[Tildohsi]], is positioned in the western reaches of the forest, just a few miles deep where the canopy thickens. The Partition began as a group of Deltan citizens who were turned by the exiled leader [[Avan Persevet]]—banished by the Chain of Delta for uniting people against the state during the rise of [[Fuscia Lustin]]. Avan, operating from outside Delta, managed to sway people to his cause by poisoning naturally-occurring photometal veins in [[Vokar]] soil, harvested after the mass death of Bluma in the region. This act allowed Avan's ideas to spread: he feared the corruption of the Chain would merge politics and industry, resulting in the Omep Regions creating populations for state use and eliminating social mobility.

When Avan Persevet was rumored to be hiding in the Clutched Forest with followers, the Chain of Delta sent an imperial army of Kleznit—primarily Willed-Mecha created in Rasm—toward the forest. Avan, tipped off, warned his people, but the troops had already reached the winter plains west of the Clutched Forest. This event, known as the [[212 Shift]] to the Tildohsi, is not recognized by the Chain of Delta. Avan tricked the soldiers into entering the forest, using its homefield advantage and the territorial nature of [[Sevfres]] to destroy mecha operators and Willed-Mecha. Willed-Mecha entered first, followed by Huma fighters. The Chain surrounded the western forest line, and when Huma soldiers attempted to flee (unlike Willed-Mecha, who do not flee), they were shot—a tactic of the Chain to kill deserters. Some Chain-affiliated Huma soldiers were also taken hostage.

## Ecology and Resources

The Clutched Forest is renowned for its rich natural resources, which have attracted a variety of inhabitants and competing interests over the centuries. The interplay of saltwater and freshwater systems creates a unique environment where rare plants and animals thrive, making the forest a vital source of food, medicine, and raw materials. The region’s proximity to the [[Swirling Sea]] and the [[World Gyre]] has also shaped its climate and trade routes, allowing for the exchange of goods and ideas with distant lands.

## Dangers and Inhabitants

Despite its abundance, the Clutched Forest is not without its dangers. The dense woods are home to powerful magical entities, most notably [[Sevfres]], whose presence has shaped the culture and survival strategies of those who dwell within the forest. Communities such as [[Tildohsi]] have developed advanced sound magic and concealment techniques to avoid drawing the attention of these beings, while also leveraging the forest’s resources for their own prosperity.

## Conflict and Preservation

The forest’s strategic importance has made it a site of frequent conflict, as rival factions vie for control over its wealth and position. The delicate balance between exploitation and preservation is a constant theme in the history of the Clutched Forest, with each generation facing new challenges and opportunities in this ever-changing landscape.

## Blue Manrotter: Subcelia of the Clutched Forest

One of the most iconic organisms of the Clutched Forest is the [[Blue Manrotter]], a type of [[Celia#Subcelia|subcelia]] mushroom. Blue Manrotters are renowned for their ability to form intricate hiveminds through waterways and mycelial networks, especially in the forest's streams, brooks, and creeks. Colonies often begin at the sources of these waterways, transferring spores and silent mycelial communication downstream. This allows Blue Manrotters to share nutrients, coordinate growth, and respond collectively to environmental changes—an ability that local peoples compare to the distributed communication and governance of the [[Tildohsi Partition]].

The Blue Manrotter grows in water, anchored by a thin, flowy stem with a vertical white ribbon or pruny texture. Its cap is wide and circular, able to bend at the perimeter both up and down—forming a dome underwater or a capsule-like ball above water. These mushrooms are found at the shallow edges of creeks, rivers, and other waterways throughout the forest.

Blue Manrotters thrive on the abundance of creatures that die searching for freshwater in the forest. They spread their spores downstream, ensuring they can capture decaying corpses for nourishment. When a carcass is present, the mushroom bends its cap to envelop and consume it—downward for aquatic creatures, upward for land animals. Excess nutrients from a decaying body can be shared with nearby manrotters through their connected stems.

It is a ritual in the Clutched Forest, especially among the [[Tildohsi Partition]] and other local peoples, to offer small animals to the Blue Manrotter. As the mushroom consumes the offering, it quickly releases bioluminescent blue spores, visible as glowing streams in the water. These spores heat the water and serve as guides through the dark forest, where the canopy blocks moonlight. However, the Blue Manrotter is also infamous for its seductive and deadly properties: those weakened or near death who drink spore-heated water are slowly consumed from within, eventually compelled to return to the mushroom to offer their body for rebirth.

Folklore tells of Blue Manrotters assuming [[Huma]] forms in celial springs, luring bathers to their deaths. While some claim to have escaped this fate, such stories are difficult to verify. Celial springs—ponds or rivers with many manrotters—are sites of constant decay and renewal, with the mushrooms releasing more spores when consuming live creatures than plant matter. This rapid spore release is a survival tactic for enduring harsh winters, when fewer corpses are available.
