Solscept is an architectural wonder of education that rises from the center of the city into reaches into the sky, before pouring outwards like a fountain or blooming plant. As it reaches, it carries the terrain with it, from which topographical ring-like steps have been created to match the natural elevation change of the environment upon first settlement. In certain areas outside of the Solscept, the stairs rise up towards no building then fall back down. It is common for artists of all kinds to set themselves up on these natural stair pedestals to perform or work on projects.
