## The Tale

Once, when the grass was greenest and the trash piles were tall, I—Tiny, the smallest halfling in Cilladril—met Tong, the biggest beetle in all the world. Tong was rolling a dung-ball so grand it sparkled with Hypri glass and bits of old clockwork. I waved and shouted, "Need a hand, friend?" and Tong, with a voice like thunder in a barrel, said, "Hop on, Tiny!"

We rolled through the city, squishing trash and singing songs. The children cheered, the elders waved, and the grass parted before us. Tong told me stories of the old days, when he was just a little grub and the city was only a dream in Sibannac's mind.

But Tong gave me a warning: "Never poke my belly, and never steal my dung-ball. I only bite the mean and the greedy." I promised, and we rolled on, making the city cleaner and the day brighter.

When dusk came, Tong hummed a tune that made the grass dance, and I slid off his back, waving goodbye. Now, whenever you hear the grass singing at sunset, that's Tong and me, keeping Cilladril rolling along.

## Moral

Be kind to the helpers of the city, and they'll carry you far. But if you trouble Tong, beware—he's gentle, but not to those who harm the Growth.
