Gaia is an **[[Imaan Plane]]** within the Toman Ecoss, known as the Plane of All Light Consumption. Formed on the back of the massive Primordial Alwa, Gaia is a realm where light is absorbed and transformed, feeding the beliefs of its inhabitants.

### Characteristics

- **Plane of Light Consumption**: Gaia is characterized by its ability to consume and harness light, using it to sustain the beliefs and life forms that exist within the plane.
- **Connection to Alwa**: Gaia was first formed on the back of Alwa, the massive Celia Primordial, and has since become a self-sustaining plane that feeds on the sun's light.

### Cultural Significance

Gaia is closely tied to the beliefs of the **[[Preservus]]** phylum, which values the preservation of life and the careful management of natural resources. The plane is a symbol of balance and harmony within the Toman Ecoss, serving as a reminder of the importance of living in accordance with nature.
