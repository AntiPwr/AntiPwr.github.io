Chantae is the omnipresent mind and goddess of the Celia Kingdom. She is not a physical being, but a collective presence experienced through all Celia. Chantae is the source of the Celia's will, and her influence is felt through the hivemind known as Mycelism. She is described as a mesmerizing vision of fungal beauty, but her true nature is beyond individual comprehension. Chantae's followers act to ensure survival and rebirth, not out of malice, but as an expression of the cycle of decay and renewal.

Goddess of Celia

“Chantae, Goddess of Celia, is said to be a mesmerizing vision of fungal beauty. Her presence is a blend of earthy mystique and otherworldly allure. She stands tall, her form gracefully elongated like a slender, delicate mushroom stem. Her skin is akin to the finest porcelain, which carries a subtle luminescence, reminiscent of the soft glow that bathes the forest floor under a full moon. Her eyes, the color of deep forest moss, hold the wisdom of ages, and within their depths, the mysteries of the mushroom kingdom are unveiled. Long tendrils of hair cascade down her back like chanterelle fronds, radiating a soft, golden hue.

  

Adorning her form are intricate garments woven from the finest threads of mycelium, adorned with spore patterns that seem to dance and shift as if alive. She exudes an enchanting fragrance, a harmonious blend of earthy, rich soil, and the delicate scent of fresh fungi, enticing all who encounter her to linger in her presence. 

  

Chantae’s voice, when she chooses to speak, is a melodic whisper that resonates in ways that are unique each moment. Her mere presence can bring tranquility to the most restless of souls and evoke a deep sense of reverence among her Celiac followers. She is the embodiment of the forest’s hidden secrets, a guardian and mother of the fungal realm, and her beauty is as timeless as the cycles of growth and decay in the world she oversees.”

  

- From “Celia, Kingdom of One” by Mycelio, the Intricate.


  

This description, to the uninformed, may seem reliable, especially coming from a Celiac, however, this description only checks one of two boxes. The only one being that of accuracy. This is because it leaves out much more information that is crucial to the full story of Chantae. This story, like all Celiac stories, was not crafted by the individual, but by the greater whole.

  

Chantae is an omnipresent deity who can be interacted with through multitudinous fungal hosts, known as the entirety of the Celia Kingdom. She does not have a physical form, but rather a presence which, when felt or experienced, her spiritual form is known in ways words fail to describe. Chantae is not a ruler, nor a being. She is reality to those that have felt her touch. An inescapable way of life, filled with pure fulfillment and zero willpower. 

  

Chantae is the mind behind the Celia Kingdom. She controls all beings under her grasp how she sees fit for survival in this ever-changing realm. Most commonly this is accomplished through her fungal followers, known as Feasters. These creatures act in ways that try to capitalize on decaying matter, often those that are members of other kingdoms, to make them Chantae’s servants, as well as simply feast on them. This is done in a wide range of ways, from falsely befriending travelers on the road to creating alliances with Huma kingdoms that span over decades before crumbling to ruins. Ruins which, from their ashes, raise servants to the Goddess of Celia. Celia are not inherently evil, but rather unendingly focused on survival.

  

Chantae’s dominion over a creature offers them a unique form of anima. As a result, magic performed by a Celia can take on any amount of color and visual flair, even if the spell is typically a certain color such as with Fireball.
