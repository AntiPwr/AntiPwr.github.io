Chantae is the omnipresent mind and goddess of the Celia Kingdom. She is not a physical being, but a collective presence experienced through all Celia. Chantae is the source of the Celia's will, and her influence is felt through the hivemind known as Mycelism. She is described as a mesmerizing vision of fungal beauty, but her true nature is beyond individual comprehension. Chantae's followers act to ensure survival and rebirth, not out of malice, but as an expression of the cycle of decay and renewal.
