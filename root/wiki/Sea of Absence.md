# Sea of Absence

<img src="wiki_images/Sea of Absence.png"><i></i></img>

The Sea of Absence is a barren, frigid sea in the northeast of [[Toma]], off the coasts of [[Wyldere]], [[Inersa]], and [[Concordia]]. Known for its stillness and lack of marine abundance, it stands in stark contrast to the vibrant [[Swirling Sea]]. The Sea of Absence is a place of mystery and legend, often associated with endings, exile, and the unknown.

## Description

The Sea of Absence is defined by its cold, nutrient-poor waters and its reputation as a place where things are lost or forgotten. Few creatures thrive here, and those that do are often adapted to the harshest conditions. The sea is bordered by the Transient Straits, which connect it to the [[Swirling Sea]].

## Transient Straits

The Transient Straits are the two waterways that link the Swirling Sea to the Sea of Absence. These passages are perilous and rarely traveled, serving as the boundary between abundance and emptiness.

## Cultural Significance

For many cultures, the Sea of Absence represents exile, endings, and the unknown. Myths speak of lost ships, vanished peoples, and the slow erasure of memory in its depths.
