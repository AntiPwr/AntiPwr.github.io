The Swirling Sea is the largest and most influential body of water in [[Toma]], positioned centrally and touching nearly every landmass. Named for its distinctive swirling motion—driven by the [[World Gyre]]—its currents rotate either clockwise or counterclockwise, shaping the ecology, trade, and history of the plane. The Swirling Sea is a nexus of commerce, conflict, and spiritual significance, with its waters serving as both a lifeline and a battleground for the kingdoms of Toma.

## Description

The Swirling Sea is the bountiful heart of Toma, bordered by [[Sancta]], [[Usaka]], [[Theologia]], and other continents. Its swirling currents, dictated by the [[World Gyre]], influence trade routes, weather, and even the migration of marine life. The sea's central location and connection to nearly every continent make it a key player in the power dynamics of the region.

## Bas'l Straits

The Bas'l Straits, formerly the Straits of Gorisain, are a treacherous region within the Swirling Sea. Infamous for their dangerous currents and the tragic history of [[Desthema]]'s death at the hands of Gorisain during the Natural War, the Bas'l Straits are also home to the cursed [[Theiman Breach]]. This area is a twisted coral reef, corrupted by the lingering effects of Desthema's demise, and is shrouded in secrecy by the [[Cask Sistema]].

## Eternal Straits

The Eternal Straits are four major waterways leading from the Swirling Sea to the [[Sea of Presence]]. The southernmost, Trader's Tollway, is taxed by the [[Tayim Trade Republic]]. These straits are vital for trade and migration, connecting the heart of Toma to distant lands.

## Transient Straits

The Transient Straits are two waterways that connect the Swirling Sea to the [[Sea of Absence]]. These routes are less traveled and often associated with mystery and danger.

## Pearl Natura Society

At the deepest depths of the Swirling Sea lies the society of "Gujik," a vast population of resonant pearl Natura, including [[Lichen Clam|Lichen Clams]] and [[Natura#Types of Natura|Water Natura]]. This society is simple but expansive, worshipping [[Spawn of Hidraal#Lopali|Lopali]], the Serpent Ray. Sea Walker people use waterlights to live peacefully in these regions, coexisting with the pearl natura and honoring Lopali.

## Significance

The Swirling Sea is a cultural and economic nexus for Toma. Its swirling currents shape trade, weather, and the fate of civilizations. The sea is also a site of deep spiritual and historical importance, with its waters often serving as the stage for legendary events, migrations, and conflicts.
