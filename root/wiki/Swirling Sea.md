## Main Section

The **Swirling Sea** is not only a vital geographical feature but also a cultural and economic nexus for the various kingdoms and classes of Toma. Its swirling currents, powered by the [[World Gyre]], influence trade routes, weather patterns, and the migration of marine life. The sea's central location and connection to nearly every continent make it a key player in the power dynamics of the region, with its waters often serving as the battleground for control over Toma's resources and influence.

In the [[Current Line]], the Swirling Sea is swirling clockwise.

Within the Swirling Sea lies the infamous Bas'l Straits, a treacherous region formerly known as the Straits of Gorisain. The Bas'l Straits are notorious for their dangerous currents and the dark history tied to the death of [[Desthema]] at the hands of [[Gorisain]] during the Natural War. The lingering effects of this event have twisted the environment, creating the cursed [[Theiman Breach]], a place of deep historical and mystical significance. Navigating these straits is a challenge for even the most experienced sailors, and the area remains a focal point for both legend and conflict.

The Swirling Sea is also home to the [[Cask Sistema]], a unique feature that further distinguishes this body of water. The sea's influence extends far beyond its shores, shaping the destinies of those who depend on its bounty and the empires that seek to control its currents.
