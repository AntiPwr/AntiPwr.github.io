## Hollow Resources Overview
Hollow Resources are the lifeblood of technology and spirituality in Toma. They are formed when large amounts of organic or inorganic matter undergo an ideology-attuned death event. The souls once contained in that matter are severed, leaving behind concentrated deposits imbued with spiritual energy and belief. Each resource’s nature depends on the origin material and its Kingdom—a belief-aligned category of life in the world’s cosmology. These materials are extraordinarily powerful and coveted; entire civilizations have risen and fallen over their control. For a Pith Mechanic, Hollow Resources present an opportunity to craft unique devices and implants that channel their inherent magical properties.

**Key Hollow Resources:**
- **Therium** (Decara): Conducts spiritual energy and stores belief; the signature implant material for the Pith Mechanic. Formed in the feeding pits of Dar after catastrophic events, Therium contains the echo of a soul’s will, making it uniquely suited to infuse with belief and consciousness.
- **Photometal** (Bluma): Captures thoughts and beliefs via light; used for slates and visors that store illusions or memories.
- **Grame** (Decara): Consumes belief and invokes decay; used for lures, vials, and traps that sap resolve or attract decay-aligned creatures.
- **Primma/Aprima** (Celia): Radiate rebirth energy; beads and talismans promote healing, growth, or miraculous effects.
- **Dai & Iko Stones** (Ferra): Paired stones that resonate as untraceable communicators or trackers, symbolizing the eternal chase between predator and prey.

## Therium – The Core Implant Material
Therium is a dark, dense Hollow Metal of immense versatility and the cornerstone of the Pith Mechanic’s features. It is exceptionally rare, formed in the feeding pits of Dar as departing souls infuse nearby rock. The result is Therium ore—composed of a soul’s spiritual print and anima bound with trace minerals. Once implanted and attuned, Therium behaves almost like a living part of the host, establishing its own belief sphere and granting extraordinary abilities fueled by the implant. The sphere of belief within Therium can be “fed” with the Mechanic’s or host’s thoughts and emotions, effectively programming the implant with desired traits or powers.

**Why Therium?** Its ability to conduct and store spiritual energy is unparalleled. Once infused with a person’s belief or intent, it can grow in power and even develop quasi-sentience. In game terms, this could manifest as the implant “evolving” new features as the character gains levels or accomplishes significant feats. Its rarity also balances its power—obtaining a Therium core is a grand quest in itself, justified by its role as the class’s core feature. Only the most significant Wasting Events yield Therium, and it’s typically found in dangerous, high-altitude Thresholds. This explains why an adventuring Pith Mechanic might be one of the few to possess such a piece.

**Reusable but with a Cost:** Unlike most other resources, a Therium implant isn’t consumed on use—it’s a permanent augmentation. However, changing who it’s bonded to is non-trivial. The connection between the Therium and the host’s soul runs deep. If the Mechanic ever needs to remove or transfer the implant, it requires Self-Severance—a dramatic ritual that may temporarily weaken the host or have other side effects as a portion of their life-force is detached. This cost ensures that the choice of who receives the Therium implant is meaningful and not made lightly.

## Infusions and Magic Items from Other Hollow Resources
Beyond Therium, the Pith Mechanic can gather other Hollow Resources during adventures and use them to craft special infusions or magic items. Each resource offers a unique theme and power, allowing the Mechanic to expand their toolkit. However, unlike the permanent Therium implant, these resources tend to be consumable or require periodic recharge due to their volatile nature. For example:

- **Photometal Slate:** Stores thoughts and illusions when exposed to light; must be recharged in bright light.
- **Grame Lure/Decay Vial:** Emits an aura of despair or attracts decay-aligned creatures; single-use or short-duration.
- **Primma Beads:** Used for healing or purification; Aprima beads enable miraculous feats but are consumed on use.
- **Dai & Iko Resonant Stones:** Paired for communication or tracking; each pair is unique and irreplaceable.
- **Therium Shards:** Used to temporarily amplify the main implant or power a small automaton; require downtime to recharge.

**Resource Gathering, Recharge, and Risks:** Acquiring and using Hollow Resources should feel like an adventure in itself. Most require specific conditions or rituals to gather and recharge, and each carries risks—Grame can erode resolve, Photometal may record curses, and the Therium implant ties your soul to another, with all the narrative consequences that entails.
These are **single-use** or **limited-use**, tied to their resource’s nature:

1. **Photometal Slate** (Bluma)  
   - Records illusions or memories in light; projects them later as a stored spell (illusion/divination).  
   - Recharges under bright light (e.g. sunlight, day of light ritual).

2. **Grame Lure / Decay Vial** (Decara)  
   - Emits an aura that weakens enemies’ resolve (psychic damage or debuff).  
   - Attracts decay-aligned creatures.  
   - Consumable; must be refilled via a Grame extraction ritual.

3. **Primma Beads** (Celia)  
   - Each bead channels rebirth energy: small-area healing or purification aura.  
   - **Aprima** beads (rare) double potency or enable miraculous one-shots.  
   - Recharge by meditating in life-rich sites (druidic grove, mycelial nexus).

4. **Dai & Iko Resonant Stones** (Ferra)  
   - Paired stones function as untraceable long-range communicators or directional beacons for each other.  
   - Unique pairing; if one is lost, the other is useless.  
   - No recharge needed, but creating new pairs demands a predator-prey simultaneous death.

5. **Therium Shards (Lesser Nodes)**  
   - Small shards fuel **Core Harmonizer** devices: temporarily amplify the main implant or power a small automaton.  
   - Deplete on use; re-infuse during downtime by meditative ritual.

## Resource Gathering, Recharge & Risks

- **Gathering:**  
  - **Therium**: Major quest reward or dangerous Threshold caverns.  
  - **Photometal**: Harvested in illuminated ruins or after belief events.  
  - **Grame**: Extracted from fields of despair or undead lairs via rituals.  
  - **Primma**: Found in sacred rebirth sites; **Aprima** only via legendary myths.  
  - **Dai/Iko Stones**: Discovered in natural predator-prey remains or earned through trials.

- **Recharge:**  
  - Photometal & Primma need ambient light/life energy.  
  - Grame and Therium shards require downtime reinfusion.  
  - Dai/Iko stones remain eternally charged once created.

- **Risks:**  
  - **Therium implant** ties your soul to another—if they’re corrupted, you risk backlash.  
  - **Self-Severance** carries narrative/ mechanical penalties (e.g. reduced max HP or abilities).  
  - **Grame** can erode your own resolve or attract undead.  
  - **Photometal** may inadvertently record curses if misused.
