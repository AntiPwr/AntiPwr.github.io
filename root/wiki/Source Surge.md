# Source Surge

*“Human beings are poor examiners, subject to superstition, bias, prejudice, and a PROFOUND tendency to see what they want to see rather than what is really there."* - **Scott M. Peck**

A source surge, or belief event, may occur throughout the game. There are two types of surges:

- **Passive Surges**: Natural events used to guide roleplay. Examples include spontaneous growth of roots from a druid’s grief, or a fighter feeling sudden renewed vigor.
- **Controlled Surges**: Intentional activations of belief by channeling on personal "Claims"—aspects of a character’s faith, virtues, purpose, oaths, and connections.

**Claims**:  
Represent core aspects of a character (Faith, Virtue, Purpose, Oath, Connection). Once all are filled, players can coordinate with the DM to form an avatar of their belief, a manifestation of their ideals given tangible form.

**Restorative Meditation**:  
After using a controlled surge, a character must rest for a week or meditate to restore their abilities. Daily meditative practices speed recovery, each hour of meditation reduces downtime by a day.

**Flow State & Stagnant State**:  
- *Flow State*: A meditative state representing perfect alignment of focus.
- *Stagnant State*: A contrasting meditative approach with different narrative implications.
