# Source Surge

*“Human beings are poor examiners, subject to superstition, bias, prejudice, and a PROFOUND tendency to see what they want to see rather than what is really there."* - **Scott M. Peck**

<!-- wiki-header-section:end -->

A source surge, or belief event, may occur throughout the game. There are two types of surges:

- **Passive Surges**: Natural events used to guide roleplay. Examples include spontaneous growth of roots from a druid’s grief, or a fighter feeling sudden renewed vigor.
- **Controlled Surges**: Intentional activations of belief by channeling on personal "Claims"—aspects of a character’s faith, virtues, purpose, oaths, and connections.

**Claims**:  
Represent core aspects of a character (Faith, Virtue, Purpose, Oath, Connection). Once all are filled, players can coordinate with the DM to form an avatar of their belief, a manifestation of their ideals given tangible form.

**Restorative Meditation**:  
After using a controlled surge, a character must rest for a week or meditate to restore their abilities. Daily meditative practices speed recovery, each hour of meditation reduces downtime by a day.

**Flow State & Stagnant State**:  
- *Flow State*: A meditative state representing perfect alignment of focus.
- *Stagnant State*: A contrasting meditative approach with different narrative implications.

The Source Surge System consists of two main components: Passive Surges and Controlled Surges.

### Passive Surges

A Passive Surge is an event that occurs naturally within the [[Toman Ecoss]] without direct control from individuals. These surges are manifestations of powerful and overlapping belief spheres, influenced by entities such as [[Nesa]] or religious [[Order]]s. Passive Surges can be used at the discretion of the DM to enhance storytelling and create dynamic interactions.

- **Perception of Delusions**: In areas with strong overlapping belief spheres, creatures may perceive delusions as small passive surges of connection, contributing to the existence of [[False Nesa]].
- **Druid's Grief**: A druid's tears over a fallen creature might cause roots to sprout from the ground.
- **Weight Lifted**: A fighter encountering their enemy may feel a surge of energy, shedding exhaustion.
- **Celebration of the Champion**: The return of a celebrated hero might inspire a spontaneous village celebration.

### Controlled Surges

Controlled Surges are the second component of the Source Surge System. They allow players to channel their beliefs actively, drawing upon all filled Claim Boxes that represent different aspects of their character's convictions. By activating a Controlled Surge, players invoke a powerful belief event that encompasses the entirety of their character's belief system.

#### Claim Boxes

Characters fill out Claim Boxes on their character sheets, representing their beliefs and values:

1. **Faith Box**: Deity, religion, or leader your character worships.
2. **Virtue Box**: Core virtue or moral principle your character holds dearest.
3. **Purpose Box**: Overarching goal or purpose in life.
4. **Oath Box**: An oath or promise made by your character.
5. **Connection Box**: An important relationship or bond your character has.

(Optional Rule) Claim Boxes may be hidden until discovered or attuned to during gameplay, providing a sense of progression and exploration.

#### Activating a Controlled Surge

As an action, players can activate a Controlled Surge by selecting all their filled Claim Boxes. The power and effect should reflect the combined emotional impact and context of the roleplay moment.

**Example:**

- **Faith Box**: Scendilism
- **Virtue Box**: Justice
- **Purpose Box**: To avenge my fallen family
- **Oath Box**: I will protect the weak
- **Connection Box**: My bond with my party.

Activating a Controlled Surge invokes a belief event that encompasses all these aspects, granting the character an extraordinary boost in power or insight, reflecting their deepest convictions and motivations.

#### Forming an Avatar of Belief

Upon filling all Claim Boxes, players have the opportunity to collaborate with the DM to create an avatar of their belief. This avatar embodies the essence of the character's beliefs and serves as a manifestation of their spiritual power. The avatar can take various forms, depending on the player's beliefs, and offers unique abilities and enhancements during a Controlled Surge.

### Restorative Meditation

After a surge, characters must undergo reflection and restoration through extended rest or focused meditation to harness their beliefs effectively again.

#### Extended Rest

A minimum of one week of rest restores a character's ability to activate claims, allowing recovery from mental and emotional exertion.

#### Meditative Practices

Characters can expedite recovery through daily meditation, engaging in practices like prayer, mental exercises, and rituals. Each two-hour meditation session reduces the cooldown by one day.

#### Role-Playing Meditation

Players should vividly describe their character's meditation practices, environment, and internal reflections, enhancing narrative depth and personal growth.












Deathground as a belief event. Spira should connect heavily to this.
