The **Rites of Huma** are foundational doctrines within [[Asceptim]] faith and [[Sol Unita]] law, outlining the philosophical, spiritual, and political expectations of Huma under the guidance of [[Asath]]. These rites serve as a framework for governance, social conduct, and ascension, influencing the cultural and legal structure of [[Scender]] and the greater Sol Unita dominion.

Each rite is housed within an [[Ester Slate]], sacred artifacts said to contain divine instruction. Among them, the [[Rite of Passage]] is believed to predate all others, originating from an era before the [[Cel Blindbirth Line]], a time some claim to have existed before time itself.

## Rites of Huma

### Rite of Passage

The [[Rite of Passage]] defines the ultimate goal of Huma—to achieve ascension. It is said that this document predates existence, written by [[Asath]] to guide Huma toward enlightenment and eventual transcendence into **Sol Proscima**. This rite serves as the foundation upon which all other rites are built.

### Rite of Rule

The [[Rite of Rule]] establishes that **true rule requires deep understanding**. Power is not granted by birthright alone but by an individual’s ability to **engage with the faith, struggles, and perspectives of those they govern**. This rite influences leadership structures within Sol Unita, ensuring that those in power remain connected to the people.

### Rite of Recomposition

The [[Rite of Recomposition]] dictates that **technology should be used to harness decomposition processes**, reflecting the story of the **Reins of Alwa**. It is based on the belief that Huma must take on a guiding role in the natural cycle of life and death, replacing the [[Kingdom#Empire Function|Empire Function]] of the [[Celia]] kingdom. This rite plays a central role in Scender’s **technological and ecological development**, particularly in waste processing and resource reclamation.

### Rite of Egress

The [[Rite of Egress]] emphasizes **never returning to past suffering**, drawing from the historical exile of Huma from [[Endem]]. It serves as both a **personal and societal doctrine**, shaping Sol Unita’s empathetic approach to asylum seekers and ensuring that those who enter Scender’s fold seek a future without the burdens of their past.

### Rite of Transference

The [[Rite of Transference]] mandates that **positions of power must transfer upon signs of enlightenment**. When an individual achieves a higher state of wisdom or understanding, they are expected to relinquish their position to another deemed more capable. This principle ensures a continual evolution of leadership, preventing stagnation and maintaining the fluidity of progress. This is the rite that led to the ascension of [[Ophelia Necesse]] as Queen of Scender.

## Influence on Sol Unita Governance

The Rites of Huma shape nearly every aspect of Sol Unita’s political, religious, and economic structures. The interpretation of these rites is overseen by **[[Guides]]**, religious and legal scholars who ensure their adherence within Sol Unita society. While the rites are considered divine truths, they remain subject to evolving interpretation, allowing governance to adapt over time.
