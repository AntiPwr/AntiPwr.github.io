A **Celial Spring** (also known as a **Celia Watering Hole**) is any location in [[Toma]] where [[Celia]]—especially subcelia like [[Manrotter|Manrotters]]—thrive by taking advantage of the hunting and migration patterns of [[Ferra]] and other creatures in search of freshwater. These springs are vital ecological sites, serving as both sources of life and centers of decay and renewal in the natural world of Toma.

## Description

Celial springs are ponds, rivers, or other water bodies where celia—especially subcelia mushrooms—grow in abundance. These locations are shaped by the constant movement of animals, particularly [[Ferra]], who come to drink, hunt, or migrate. The presence of these creatures provides a steady supply of nutrients for the celia, which thrive on decaying organic matter left behind by both predator and prey.

## Ecological Role

Celial springs are crucial for the cycling of nutrients in Toma's ecosystems. As animals gather and sometimes perish at these watering holes, celia—including unique subcelia like the [[Blue Manrotter]] (found in the [[Clutched Forest]] of [[Wyldere]])—rapidly decompose remains, releasing spores and bioluminescent compounds into the water. This process not only recycles nutrients but also creates unique visual phenomena—glowing blue streams and heated waters that can guide travelers or serve as warnings of danger.

## Folklore and Dangers

Celial springs are often featured in local folklore as places of both healing and peril. While the waters may offer warmth and light in the darkness, they are also associated with the seductive dangers of celia, which can lure weakened or dying creatures to their end. Stories abound of travelers encountering mysterious figures or being drawn into the water by the hypnotic glow of spores.
