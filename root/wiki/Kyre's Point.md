Kyre's Point is a significant monument located atop the eastern of two **[[Primma]]** cliff jetties off the coast of central **[[Sancta]]**, forming part of the **[[Scender#Jetti Sound|Jetti Sound]]** in **[[Scender]]**. This site serves as both a monument to **[[Kyre]]** (now known as **[[Trenjor and Voyimus#Trenjor|Trenjor]]**) and an airship tower for public and private travel along the **[[Swirling Sea]]**'s winds.

Kyre's Point, along with **[[Luin's Point]]** to the west, flanks the entrance to the Jetti Sound, creating a symbolic and physical gateway to the heart of Scender. The two points are intrinsically linked, representing the duality of Kyre and **[[Luin]]** (who became **[[Trenjor and Voyimus#Voyimus|Voyimus]]**), and their roles in the spiritual evolution of Sol Unita. These points not only serve as monuments to their legacies but also as practical centers for air travel, connecting Scender to the wider world.

Kyre's Point is revered for its breathtaking views and its deep historical and spiritual significance. The site is a pilgrimage destination for those seeking to connect with Kyre's legacy and the divine transformation she underwent. The monument stands as a testament to Kyre's unwavering faith, her journey, and her ultimate ascension.
