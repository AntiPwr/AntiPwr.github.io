**Class**: **Tayim Trade Republic**

The **Tayim Trade Republic** is the ruling class of the westernmost regions of the [[Sansari Desert]] and once ruled [[Old Badaba]] before the [[Battle of the Banquet]] ended their control. Operating through two major cities, [[Duvit]] and the capital of [[Tayim]], the Republic maintains strict policies on trade and cultural integration. This republic is characterized by its architectural grandeur, intricate glasswork, and adherence to strict societal hierarchies.

### Culture and Society

The Republic places great value on architectural elegance, with their capital, Tayim, showcasing a blend of influences that merge fine architecture with intricate glass designs. The Republic's followers adhere to the teachings of **[[Ashprahm]]**, focusing on spiritual and cultural purity. The exotic animal trade thrives within the Republic, but only plants that can survive the desert are highly regarded, such as cacti and air plants.

The destruction of Old Badaba was a response to a rebellion that sought to undermine the Republic’s control. The remnants of the Tayim Trade Republic remain heavily invested in conservative views on expansion and dominance, viewing rebellion against their rule as an existential threat to their empire.

### Hands of Governance

The Tayim Trade Republic is governed by two distinct local governments in the cities of [[Duvit]] and [[Tayim]], each maintaining control over its respective territory. These two hands of governance ensure that the Republic’s interests are enforced across the land, with Tayim serving as the capital. Duvit, on the other hand, is more focused on trade and economic growth, serving as the Republic’s gateway to the outside world.

### Military and Trade Influence

The Tayim Trade Republic has a powerful military presence, which it uses to enforce its authority and maintain control over its territories. Its trade empire is vast, dealing in exotic animals, valuable minerals, and unique plants capable of surviving in desert climates. Their focus on expansion and control has made them a dominant force in the region, though the rebellion that led to the fall of Old Badaba remains a sore spot in their history.

### Cultural and Architectural Influence

The architectural grandeur of the Tayim Trade Republic is renowned, with its capital showcasing a blend of desert-inspired designs and intricate glasswork that reflects the Republic’s wealth and power. The spiritual life in Tayim is dominated by Ashprahm, with temples and shrines dedicated to its teachings scattered throughout the city.

However, the remnants of the Republic’s influence on New Badaba can still be felt in the **[[Oshe]]** practices, a subtle reminder of the spiritual legacy that the Republic left behind after the fall of Old Badaba.

### Inspiration

The governance and architecture of the **Tayim Trade Republic** are inspired by a combination of **Spanish colonialism** and **Middle Eastern** architectural styles, with grand structures and an emphasis on glasswork reflecting the wealth and power of the ruling elite. The **Tayim** people’s control over trade, military power, and cultural integration mirrors the colonial expansionist ideologies of **Imperial Spain** and other Mediterranean empires.








The Tayim Trade Republic's lower class is extremely minimalist, often seen as impoverished. In truth, this is the case, however their belief allows them to generally be at least neutral, if not happy and grateful for their circumstances. Family is of major importance within the culture of the republic.













In the early days of Tayim, when it was referred to as Tado, there used to be a belief in a god named Deluse Dio. militia men, hunters, and adventurers would carry glass balls, half filled with sand, the other half with air. These are made of [[Sar Glass]] and are said to be impossible to break by hand. However, it is said that when the time is needed, if you break it, you will be saved from what ails you. This grew into a deus ex machina faith with the god being named [[Deluse Dio]]. These trinkets are remembered in history but are no longer found in Tayim following an ideology shift to [[Ashprahm]] prior to the [[Line from Few]]. This trinket is called a Dim and it is also used by children to play with because it doesnt break.







[[Nozaiaq]] is an island of Sar Glass used as a lifelong penal colony, focused on harvesting the glass. However, the glass is incredibly difficult to harvest, it is both resilient, but when it meets its threshold it will shatter in large troves, leading to pitfalls and other dangerous mining incidents. Although, these people are prisoners and this is justified for the Tayim Trade Republic's growth through trade of their most valuable hollow resource. The island experiences strange cosmic events due to being near the shelf. sometimes people will see reflections of masses on the glass, etc.
