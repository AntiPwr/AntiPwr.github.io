# Cilladril
_The Grass City, Grove of Waste, Sibannac's Heart_

**Cilladril** is a remarkable city at the edge of Hypri, built within a grove of low grass, soil, and the ever-accumulating trash ejected from Hypri and its sister cities. Here, Sibannac's Growthmind transforms waste into the foundation of society—blurring the line between plant, person, and city.

## Structure and Society

Cilladril's architecture is a patchwork of glass shards, twisted metal, mechanical parts, wood, and other refuse, all ingeniously woven together with living grass and roots. The city's infrastructure is a living, growing organism: trash is not merely dumped, but actively recycled by the Growthmind and its people. Metal beams become bridges, glass fragments form windows and mosaics, gears and springs are repurposed into communal tools, and wood is layered into walkways and shelters. Waste is used as fertilizer, enriching the soil and feeding both the grass and the people.

The people of Cilladril—members of the Usakan Growth—live in a highly empathetic, communal society. Social standards are high: cooperation, care for neighbors, and emotional support are central values. The Growthmind's influence fosters unity and a sense of belonging, and most residents feel genuinely content and supported in their daily lives.

However, the abundance of waste brings risks. Disease can spread among those who do not wear protective clothing, as the environment is rich in decomposing material and sometimes hazardous debris. Despite this, the communal culture and the Growthmind's guidance help mitigate many dangers, and life is generally vibrant and creative.

Cilladril's people aspire to unite with Hypri, but Hypri's government and native population hold deep prejudice against the "lower ground" and Sibannac's domain, seeing it as a threat to their identity and autonomy.



## The Tale of Tong

Among the many wonders of Cilladril is the legendary dung beetle known as **[[Tong]]**, a [[Primordial]] creature said to help maintain the city's balance. Tong is revered as a friend of the Growth, rolling great balls of waste and clearing paths for new growth. Folk tales say he is gentle and wise, only dangerous to those who seek to harm him or the city.

    <b>Tiny's Tale of Tong:</b><br>
    "I once rode atop Tong, the biggest beetle you ever did see! His shell sparkled with bits of Hypri glass, and his horns were tangled with grass and wire. We rolled a mountain of trash together, laughing as the city cheered us on. Tong only gets cross if you poke his belly or steal his dung-ball—otherwise, he's the best friend a halfling could have. When the grass sings at dusk, that's Tong humming along, keeping the city clean and the stories rolling."<br>
