The Tildohsi Partition is a unique class within the world of Scape, composed of a symbiotic society of [[Huma]], [[Ferra]], [[Automata]], and [[Celia]]. This community is renowned for its mastery of sound magic and its ability to survive in the shadow of powerful adversaries through ingenuity, cooperation, and the strategic use of their environment. The Partition is most notable for its construct-enhanced Ferra, known as Worg riders, who blend beast mastery with advanced construct technology. Their homeland, the Clutched Forest, provides both sanctuary and challenge, as it is protected by the enigmatic entity known as [[Sevfres]].

## Main Section

The Tildohsi Partition is a society that thrives on the edge of danger, nestled within the [[Clutched Forest]]â€”a dark, resource-rich woodland that opens onto the plains they control. Their survival is owed to a combination of strategic retreat, magical innovation, and the indirect protection of [[Sevfres]], a powerful entity bound to the forest. The Partition is not the strongest force in the region, especially compared to the formidable Chain of Delta, but it endures through clever use of terrain and alliances.

The ruling population consists of Huma and Automata, but the Partition is notable for extending liberties and opportunities for social development to Ferra and Celia. This symbiotic environment is designed to both resist the threat of Sevfres and benefit from its presence. The society is marked by a dedication to truth, fostered by a shared animosity toward the Chain of Delta, and a culture of silence, necessitated by Sevfres' sensitivity to sound.

Communication within the Partition is primarily conducted through journalism and written language. On the outskirts of the Clutched Forest, people whisper to avoid detection, while soundproofed underground rooms and buildings allow for normal conversation. The Partition's origins lie in a silent liberation movement, which used forbidden sound magic to resist the Chain of Delta from within.

Advancist Ferra, known for their construct enhancements, serve as Worg riders and beast masters, blending the strengths of both organic and mechanical forms. The Partition survives through a system of taxation and resource management, leveraging their unique skills and the protection of the forest to maintain autonomy.
