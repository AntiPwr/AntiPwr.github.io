# Tildohsi Partition

The Tildohsi Partition is a [[class]] that operates within the [[Clutched Forest]] of Middle [[Wyldere]], composed of a symbiotic society of [[Huma]], [[Ferra]], [[Automata]], and [[Celia]]. This community is renowned for its mastery of sound magic and its ability to survive in the shadow of powerful adversaries through ingenuity, cooperation, and the strategic use of their environment. The Partition is most notable for its construct-enhanced Ferra, known as Worg riders, who blend beast mastery with advanced construct technology. Their homeland, the Clutched Forest, provides both sanctuary and challenge, as it is protected by the enigmatic entity known as [[Sevfres]].

## Main Section

The Tildohsi Partition is the largest organized population in the Clutched Forest (140,000 HR), composed of a symbiotic society of [[Huma]], [[Ferra]], [[Automata]], and [[Celia]]. The capital city, [[Tildohsi]], is positioned in the western reaches of the forest, just a few miles deep where the canopy thickens. The Partition is a society that thrives on the edge of danger, nestled within the [[Clutched Forest]]—a dark, resource-rich woodland that opens onto the plains they control. Their survival is owed to a combination of strategic retreat, magical innovation, and the indirect protection of [[Sevfres]], a powerful entity bound to the forest. The Partition is not the strongest force in the region, especially compared to the formidable Chain of Delta, but it endures through clever use of terrain and alliances.

The ruling population consists of Huma and Automata, but the Partition is notable for extending liberties and opportunities for social development to Ferra and Celia. This symbiotic environment is designed to both resist the threat of Sevfres and benefit from its presence. The society is marked by a dedication to truth, fostered by a shared animosity toward the Chain of Delta, and a culture of silence, necessitated by Sevfres' sensitivity to sound.

Communication within the Partition is primarily conducted through journalism and written language. On the outskirts of the Clutched Forest, people whisper to avoid detection, while soundproofed underground rooms and buildings allow for normal conversation.

The Partition began as a group of Deltan citizens who were turned by the exiled leader [[Avan Persevet]]—banished by the Chain of Delta for uniting people against the state during the rise of [[Fuscia Lustin]]. Avan, operating from outside Delta, managed to sway people to his cause by poisoning naturally-occurring photometal veins in [[Vokar]] soil, harvested after the mass death of Bluma in the region. This act allowed Avan's ideas to spread: he feared the corruption of the Chain would merge politics and industry, resulting in the Omep Regions creating populations for state use and eliminating social mobility.

When Avan Persevet was rumored to be hiding in the Clutched Forest with followers, the Chain of Delta sent an imperial army of Kleznit—primarily Willed-Mecha created in Rasm—toward the forest. Avan, tipped off, warned his people, but the troops had already reached the winter plains west of the Clutched Forest. This event, known as the [[212 Shift]] to the Tildohsi, is not recognized by the Chain of Delta. Avan tricked the soldiers into entering the forest, using its homefield advantage and the territorial nature of [[Sevfres]] to destroy mecha operators and Willed-Mecha. Willed-Mecha entered first, followed by Huma fighters. The Chain surrounded the western forest line, and when Huma soldiers attempted to flee (unlike Willed-Mecha, who do not flee), they were shot—a tactic of the Chain to kill deserters. Some Chain-affiliated Huma soldiers were also taken hostage.

Advancist Ferra, known for their construct enhancements, serve as Worg riders and beast masters, blending the strengths of both organic and mechanical forms. The Partition survives through a system of taxation and resource management, leveraging their unique skills and the protection of the forest to maintain autonomy.
