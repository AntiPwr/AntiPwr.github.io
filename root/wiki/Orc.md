Fear of Cruelty (referring to mental and physical anguish, primal destructive nature caused by appealing to inner darkness)










An orc, as a personification of a fear of Huma, embody the dread of one's own capacity for cruelty—the dark, untamed savagery lurking within us all. In many narratives, orcs are depicted as monstrous, brutal beings; yet this monstrosity is often a mirror reflecting the hidden, violent impulses we deny in ourselves. This archetype taps into the existential terror of what might happen if we fully embraced that inner darkness—if our civilization crumbled and our primal, destructive nature was unleashed without restraint.

In this interpretation, the orc isn’t merely an external enemy but a symbol of self-inflicted harm. It suggests that the fear is not so much of an alien other, but rather of the monstrous potential within our own human nature—the capacity for unbridled aggression, cruelty, and the subsequent self-destruction that can follow.
