# Delta

**Delta** is a technologically advanced yet deeply corrupt [[order]] in the [[Vokar]] floodplains, ruled by the totalitarian [[Chain of Delta|Chain]]. The city prioritizes efficiency, productivity, and narrative above all else, at the cost of its citizens’ well-being. Since the [[Line from Few]], electricity has been generated and used in society by abusing and exploiting Natura, fueling rapid industrial growth. Early in the [[Current Line]], Delta and the Chain reaches a new era of hyperindustry (frostpunk/cyberpunk) and ethnonationalism.

## Society and Governance
Delta’s governance is heavily militarized, especially within its three Omep Regions, each ruled by autocrats loyal to Fuscia Lustin and known as the Chain Triarch or Archs. The Omep Regions are:

- **Rasm**: The northwestern and poorest region, bordered by the edge of the plane to the west and the Vok Wall to the north. Rasm is a harsh, desolate area where survival is a daily struggle. The people of Rasm live in extreme poverty, with little access to resources or opportunities. The government’s control over Rasm is absolute, with the region being heavily militarized to prevent any attempts at rebellion or escape. This is the production center of Delta. Ruled by **Selyman Oth**.

- **Almalek**: The second poorest region, located to the southwest of Estal Link and bordered by the ocean to the south. Almalek is ruled by **Isaheim Maddows**, a necromancer who uses a skeletal military force to maintain control. The people of Almalek live in fear of Isaheim and his undead soldiers, with many having resigned themselves to a life of oppression and despair. This region maintains agricultural and resource-harvesting requirements.

- **Kleznit**: The northeastern Omep region, reserved for government and military operations. This area is strictly controlled, with access granted only to those with 3rd level Photometal implants. The Military District houses one of Delta’s two exits, a heavily guarded route that is only accessible with explicit government permission. This region serves as the nerve center of Delta’s military power, with its soldiers being heavily drugged and conditioned to obey orders without question. Ruled by the Kleznit Leader.

The Omep Regions are a stark contrast to the wealth and prosperity of Estal Link, with the people living under constant surveillance, control, and fear. The government's use of Photometal to track and monitor the population ensures that no one can escape their grip.

The Chain Triarch are the three Omep Region rulers, excluding Fuscia Lustin. Each Chain ruler is known as an Arch:
- **Isaheim Maddows** (Almalek)
- **Selyman Oth** (Rasm)
- **Kleznit Leader** (Kleznit)

An Arch is an Omep Region Chain Triarch leader within the Chain of Delta.

## Estal Link: The Public Facade
Estal Link is the affluent region of Delta, stretching from the port to the city center, where the Illid Munis is located. This area is the only part of Delta that engages in both import and export trade, with its open market accessible only to those with citizenship in the Chain of Delta. During specific times of the year, Estal Link opens to global trade, presenting Delta as a prosperous and well-ordered city. In reality, the wealth of Estal Link is built on the suffering and exploitation of the Omep Region sectors, which are closed off to outsiders.

## MExtrema: The Hidden Operation
A key aspect of Delta’s internal economy and social control is the secret operation known as MExtrema. Under this program, the government produces and distributes various drugs through third-party vendors, perceived as unaffiliated with the state. This operation controls the population by fostering addiction and identifies the most successful drug users in society, who are studied to replicate their traits in others, much like Fuscia Lustin has done with his own drug use.

## Military Power and Drug Use
Delta’s military is infamous for its use of drugs in combat, making its soldiers unpredictable and terrifying. The drugs administered enhance endurance, aggression, and pain tolerance, giving them a significant advantage. This chemically enhanced force is a cornerstone of Delta’s security, deterring threats and maintaining dominance in the region.

## The Hidden Reality
Beneath the surface, Delta is a society built on deception, control, and exploitation. The power grid, seen as a marvel of Fuscia Lustin's leadership, is actually a product of extreme cruelty towards the Electricity Natura. The leader's public persona as a champion of progress and innovation masks the horrific truth of how the city's power is maintained. Delta appears to thrive, but is rotting from within due to the corruption and moral decay of its leadership.

**Bin**: [[Scape]]  
**Basin**: [[Sacrus]]  
**Eco**: [[Toma]] ([[Vokar]], [[Wyldere]]) of [[Toman Ecoss]]  
**Kingdom**: [[Huma]], [[Automata]] ([[Willed-Mecha]]), and [[Celia]] ([[Hallid]] and [[Clol]])  
**Phylum**: [[Klesn]]  
**Class**: [[Chain of Delta]]  
**Order**: **Delta**

**Population**: 242,000 ([[Omep Region]]) 37,000 ([[Estal Link]])

**Delta** is a technologically advanced yet deeply corrupt [[Order]] within the Toman Ecoss, ruled by the totalitarian regime known as the **[[Chain of Delta]]**. Delta is a society that prioritizes efficiency and productivity above all else, often at the cost of its citizens’ well-being. The state uses **[[Natura]]** to generate electricity, fueling its rapid industrial growth while simultaneously creating pollution pits and other environmental hazards.

#### Society and Governance

Delta’s governance is heavily militarized, particularly within its three [[Omep Region]] regions, which are ruled by autocrats aligned with **[[Fuscia Lustin]]**. The Omep regions are divided into three sectors, with the poorest sector, **[[Rasm]]**, located at the northern edge of the plane. **[[Almalek]]**, the second poorest, lies to the south and borders the **[[Swirling Sea]]**. The eastern sector is a militarized zone reserved for government and military operations, strictly controlled and requiring enhanced [[Photometal]] implants for entry. This sector also houses one of Delta’s two exits, a heavily guarded route that is only accessible with explicit government permission.

Delta operates a tightly controlled society where citizens must apply for jobs through the government, which in turn dictates their place of residence and social standing. The edge of the plane is used as an artificial border to conserve resources, with the poorest regions forced to live near this inhospitable boundary. **[[Photometal]]** implants are integral to this control, used extensively to track and monitor the population. These implants are taught as a religious rite within the **[[Klesn]]** phylum, symbolizing a ward against societal pollution. In truth, they serve as tools for government surveillance, binding citizens to the state and suppressing any potential dissent.

#### Estal Link: The Public Facade of Delta

**[[Estal Link]]** is the affluent region of Delta, stretching from the port to the city center, where the **[[Illid Munis]]** is located. This area is the only part of Delta that engages in both import and export trade, with its open market accessible only to those with citizenship in the Chain of Delta. During specific times of the year, usually for a four-month period, Estal Link opens to global trade, presenting Delta as a prosperous and well-ordered city. In reality, the wealth of Estal Link is built on the suffering and exploitation of the [[Omep Region]] regions, which are closed off to outsiders.

#### MExtrema: The Hidden Operation

A key aspect of Delta’s internal economy and social control is the secret operation known as **[[MExtrema]]**. Under this program, the government produces and distributes various drugs through third-party vendors, who are perceived as unaffiliated with the state. This operation not only controls the population by fostering addiction but also identifies the most successful drug users in society. These individuals are studied to determine the factors behind their success, with the ultimate goal of replicating these traits in others, much like **[[Fuscia Lustin]]** has done with his own drug use.

#### Military Power and Drug Use

Delta’s military is infamous for its use of drugs in combat, making its soldiers an unpredictable and terrifying force. The drugs administered to these soldiers enhance their endurance, aggression, and ability to withstand pain, giving them a significant advantage over their enemies. This chemically enhanced military force is a cornerstone of Delta’s security, deterring potential threats and maintaining the state’s dominance in the region.

#### The Hidden Reality of Delta

Beneath the surface, Delta is a society built on deception, control, and exploitation. The power grid, which is seen as a marvel of **[[Fuscia Lustin]]**'s leadership, is actually a product of extreme cruelty towards the **[[Electricity Natura]]**. The leader's public persona, as a champion of progress and innovation, masks the horrific truth of how the city's power is maintained.

This hidden reality is a reflection of the broader themes within Delta—a society that appears to be thriving but is, in fact, rotting from within due to the corruption and moral decay of its leadership.
