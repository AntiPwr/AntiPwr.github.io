Ximena Lathen is one of the three serpent sisters collectively known as the [[Ahdom Few]], who rule the city-state of [[Hypri]] through the [[Hypri Highcourt]]. As the Sea Trielder, she oversees all water-related aspects of governance and maintains authority over [[Lopali]], the Serpent Ray—one of the [[Spawn of Hidraal]]. Beyond her visible role in Hypri politics, Ximena leads a complex double life as the secretive Queen of [[Heshiu]], an isolated [[Imaan Plane]] she has cultivated as a perfect ecosystem free from outside influence.

Notable for her guarded nature and strategic brilliance, Ximena is distinguished by her mastery of liquid pressurization magic—a specialized form of elemental manipulation that allows her to control water in all its forms. To the public, she is known only as Lady Athen, concealing both her true name and her Concordian lineage to protect her carefully constructed power base.

## Origins and Concealed Identity

### Concordian Lineage

Ximena Lathen was born to the prestigious [[Esteran Leredith]] family, one of the noble houses of the [[Branches of Concordia]]. However, she has deliberately severed all connections to her heritage, going so far as to modify her public surname from "Lathen" to "Athen"—a simple subtraction of a single letter that symbolically washed away her origins.

This rejection stems not merely from political expediency but from a philosophical conviction that the Concordian people have strayed from their original purpose. Ximena believes that by isolating herself from her ancestral ties, she can create a purer vision of what the Concordian ideal should be—embodied in her hidden realm of Heshiu.

### Transformation into Lady Athen

The public persona of Lady Athen is a carefully crafted image that changes with each line, supposedly reflecting the changing waters of Heshiu. This fluid identity allows Ximena to adapt her leadership approach while maintaining a consistent authority within the Highcourt.

Only her sisters [[Jarma Konich]] and [[Siela Qane]] know her true identity, with all three having adopted modified surnames to integrate into Hypri society. While her sisters' name changes were designed to help them fit in, Ximena's was specifically crafted to isolate her from her past.

## Liquid Pressurization Magic

### Mastery and Application

Ximena is considered the foremost practitioner of liquid pressurization magic in eastern [[Toma]], capable of manipulating water at a molecular level through precise control of pressure differentials. Her abilities include:

- Altering the state of water between liquid, solid, and gas through pressure manipulation
- Creating underwater breathing environments by maintaining precise water pressure
- Generating devastating combat techniques that utilize water pressure as a cutting or crushing force
- Controlling ocean currents within limited areas, particularly around Hypri and the approaches to Heshiu

This specialized magic forms the basis for many of Heshiu's environmental systems and contributes significantly to Hypri's water management infrastructure. Ximena's expertise complements her sisters' mastery of solid (Jarma) and gaseous (Siela) pressure manipulation, creating a formidable triumvirate of elemental control.

### Teaching and Legacy

Unlike her sisters, who maintain apprentices and schools for their respective magical disciplines, Ximena rarely shares her knowledge of liquid pressurization. The few students she has taken on report rigorous training focused on perfect control and philosophical understanding of water's nature rather than raw power or practical application.

Her reluctance to teach stems from her belief that true mastery requires complete dedication to understanding water's essence—an experience she considers deeply personal and potentially compromised by premature instruction.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Sea Trielder of Hypri

As the Sea Trielder in the [[Hypri Highcourt]], Ximena oversees:

- Maintenance of water reservoirs throughout the spires
- Regulation of humidity levels to support Hypri's ecosystem
- Trade relationships with maritime powers, particularly along the eastern coast
- Diplomatic engagements with water-aligned communities and entities

Her public appearances as Lady Athen are characterized by formal precision and measured speech, revealing only what is necessary to maintain her authority and advance her objectives. She is known for wearing layered blue and green robes that seem to ripple like water when she moves—an effect enhanced by subtle applications of her pressure magic.

### Drakemaster of Lopali

Ximena's most significant power source is her control over [[Lopali]], the Serpent Ray—a massive Ferra-Water Natura hybrid creature descended from one of the three heads of [[Hidraal]]. As Drakemaster, she maintains a complex psychic bond with the primordial entity, channeling its power while simultaneously restraining its more destructive impulses.

Through this connection, Ximena gains enhanced magical capabilities and access to ancient knowledge preserved in Lopali's consciousness. The relationship is symbiotic but fraught with tension, as Lopali's inherent nature as a spawn of Hidraal includes the destructive [[Hoard Sickness]] that afflicts all primordials.

### Queen of Heshiu

Ximena's most closely guarded role is as the architect and absolute ruler of [[Heshiu]], an isolated [[Imaan Plane]] she has shaped into what she considers a perfect ecosystem. This hidden realm, accessible only through specifically tuned portals, represents her vision of an ideal world—one where carefully selected elements exist in perfect harmony under her watchful control.

Heshiu is designed as a self-sustaining environment where water cycles are regulated with absolute precision, creating ideal conditions for rare aquatic species and specialized botanical research. Ximena restricts access to this realm severely, allowing entry only to those who meet her exacting standards of purity and purpose.

    <p class="feathermark-attribution">Corvi's Feathermark</p>
    <p>The waters of Heshiu run deeper than any ocean, for they are saturated with contradiction. Ximena Lathen—that meticulous architect of perfection—has built her paradise on the very foundation she claims to reject.</p>
    <p>Look closely at the geometric patterns in Heshiu's carefully regulated tidal pools: they mirror exactly the sacred formations of early Concordian temples. The woman who erased a letter to escape her past has recreated it with obsessive precision, like a prisoner who carves her former home into her cell wall, detail by exquisite detail.</p>
    <p>What she calls "protection from outside influence" is really fear given physical form—fear that her creation cannot withstand the very contact that might validate it. She has not built a utopia but a mausoleum for a version of Concordia that never existed except in her imagination.</p>
    <p>And the most exquisite irony? The perfect ecosystem she maintains requires constant, exhausting intervention. Nothing about it is natural. It is as artificial as her name, as constructed as her public persona. The queen who pretends to let water find its own path spends every moment forcing it into channels of her own design.</p>

## Personal Ambitions and Plans

### The Imperial Growth Project

Ximena harbors ambitious plans for what she calls "Imperial Growth"—a long-term strategy to expand Heshiu's influence by deepening the [[Sea of Presence]] that surrounds it. This project aims to create conditions where the unique lichen species she cultivates can propagate beyond current boundaries, essentially extending her perfect ecosystem's reach.

The ultimate goal of this project appears to be a form of benevolent imperialism—spreading what Ximena considers an ideal environment to "improve" existing ecosystems. This vision puts her at odds with both her sisters, who favor different approaches to restoring [[Gludestit]] and addressing the primordials' [[Hoard Sickness]].

### Relationship with Fuscia Lustin

One of the few individuals who can challenge Ximena is [[Fuscia Lustin]], a powerful figure in the [[Chain of Delta]]. Their relationship is characterized by complex power dynamics and mutual respect tempered by profound ideological differences.

Notably, Fuscia Lustin does not know that Sea Trielder Ximena Lathen and Lady Leredith (Ximena's occasional alternate identity when dealing with specific external powers) are the same person. This compartmentalization allows Ximena to maintain leverage in negotiations while gathering intelligence about Delta operations that might threaten her various spheres of influence.
