# Cardinal Arts
_Four Corners of Creation_

> "The universe is born in the solitude of one, yet it cannot help but blossom into the likeness of infinity, the many. The moment a single soul discovers its purpose, the world too stirs, and countless destinies will awaken in its echo. From the first breath of being, creation yearns for companionship, and in that yearning, meaning unfolds without end."  
> **— [[Fuscia Lustin]], [[Manifesto of the Velvet]]** 

The **Cardinal Arts**, sometimes referred to as the Four Corners of Creation, are the four most fundamental categories of academic understanding of the universe, posited by the Huma perspective's within the [[Toman Ecoss]]. 

The nickname "Four Corners of Creation" arises from the plane's flat, roughly square shape. Huma culture theorizes that these four arts are the foundation of reality, drawing a metaphor between the four corners of the world and the four arts. While each corner is said to represent an art, this is not a definitive claim—rather, it is a cultural and philosophical metaphor. The relation between the plane's shape and the Cardinal Arts is not proven, and the association is symbolic rather than literal.

## Relation to Purpose Taxonomy

[[Purpose Taxonomy]] is an interdisciplinary hierarchy that aims to find the contents of one's soul through the relation it has with the environment. Essentially, this overaching umbrella classification system proposes a unification of the Cardinal Arts, combining their learnings in search of either an objective or subjective purpose within the greater universe.

## Metaphysical Connection: The Four Corners and the Search for Purpose

Within the bounds of the known world—between the four corners—lies reality as it is understood. The Cardinal Arts, metaphorically anchored to these corners, are seen as the epistemological pillars through which knowledge of existence is gained. Purpose Taxonomy seeks to define the soul by the knowledge acquired from these four arts. It is hypothesized that if mastery or understanding of all four arts is achieved, the purpose of the soul can be revealed. Once the purpose of a single soul is found, it is believed that another can be discovered, and so on—leading to the possibility of uncovering the collective, quantized purpose of all life and its relationship to the environment. This process is thought to mirror the act of creation itself, suggesting that the search for purpose is both a metaphysical journey and a reflection of the universe's own origins.
