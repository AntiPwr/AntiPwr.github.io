# Vokar
_Riverplains_

Vokar is the westernmost region of [[Wyldere]], defined by its vast brackish river delta, fertile plains, and the dramatic rise of the Summons Mountain Range to the north. The region is a land of contrasts—lush wetlands in the south, alpine valleys in the center, and icy mountains in the north. Vokar’s unique geography and climate shape its culture, economy, and way of life.

## Geography and Environment

### Southern Vokar
Vokar’s southern expanse is a vast river delta. Fertile flatlands are shaped by countless braided saltwater rivers that never freeze, even in winter. The delta is lush and green in spring and summer, with abundant crops and wildlife. Winters are long and snowy, but the rivers continue to flow, providing vital navigation and fishing year-round. Mist rises from the rivers on cold mornings, and the wetlands attract waterfowl and other wildlife.

### Central and Northern Vokar: Foothills and Highlands
As one travels north, the delta gives way to rolling flatlands, then foothills, and finally sharp mountain inclines. Spring brings alpine flowers and birch groves to the valleys, while autumn brings early frosts and snow. The far north, called Vokaris, endures arctic cold, permafrost, and patches of tundra vegetation.

### The Summons Mountain Range
Vokar’s northern border is dominated by the Summons Range—enormous, black-rock mountains streaked with snowfields and glaciers. The upper elevations are a world of stone and ice, with blinding sunlight, fierce winds, and deadly hazards. The mountains form a dramatic barrier at the edge of the continent.

## Climate and Seasons
Vokar’s climate is highly seasonal: mild, bountiful summers and long, harsh winters. The delta’s salt rivers keep the land fertile and navigable, while the highlands and mountains experience extreme cold and snow. The region’s continual rebirth each spring is a source of cultural pride and resilience.

## Culture and Settlement
Vokar’s people are shaped by the land’s abundance and challenges. Settlements cluster along the rivers and fertile plains, relying on agriculture, fishing, and trade. The delta’s unique geography fosters a culture of adaptation, endurance, and reverence for the cycles of nature. The region is also known for its wildlife, mineral resources, and the strategic importance of its waterways.
