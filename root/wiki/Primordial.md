**Kingdom**: [[Resonant]] (**Primordial**)   <br>

Primordials are ancient, colossal creatures of immense power, representing an intense interkingdom relationship through [[Resonance#Polyresonance|polyresonance]].

### Characteristics

- **Size and Power**: Primordials are typically massive in size, with abilities that surpass those of ordinary creatures. They are most often connected to a kingdom in which their [[Empire Function]] relates.
- **Polyresonance**: Primordials ar polyresonant beings, meaning their evolution is deeply connected to other kingdoms. This resonance grants them unique powers and generally exert great influence the world around them.

### Historical Significance

Primordials, through [[Bluma]] dating observations, were determined to be most influential through the [[Cel Blindbirth Line|Cel Blindbirth Line]], when [[Celia|Celia's]] overwhelming presence forced many of the Huma kingdoms to retreat underground. Upon Huma's return during the [[Line from Few]], these immense creatures are survivors of the Celia and [[Gyre Shift]]. Thus, primordials are viewed and revered by many for their power and have been featured prominently in myths and legends as a result.

### Notable Primordials

- **Alwa**: A powerful creature, claimed by [[Presceptist]] (and present day Asceptim believers), to be a demon primordial of Celia-Bluma-Natura-Huma-Spira Resonance. Alwa was said, at her zenith, to stand in each continent at once blocking out the sun at the center of the plane's atmosphere, voiding the world of light.
