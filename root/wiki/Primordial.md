# Primordial

Primordials are ancient, colossal creatures of immense power, representing an intense interkingdom relationship through [[Resonance#Polyresonance|polyresonance]]. Primordials are a [[Ferran]] evolutionary response to the rise of [[Alwa]], specifically due to the fact that the source of [[Ferra]]'s food source was [[Bluma]], and the growth of [[Gaia]] did not leave space for all [[Ferra]]. Thus, the [[Ferra]]ns who did not give in to [[Alwa]]'s dominance forged a faith called [[Gludestit]] under the great three-headed hydra [[Hidraal]]'s guidance. To the [[Ferra]]ns who did give in to Alwa's dominance, some were given refuge in Gaia's grace.

### Characteristics

- **Size and Power**: Primordials are typically massive in size, with abilities that surpass those of ordinary creatures. They are most often connected to a kingdom in which their [[Empire Function]] relates.
- **Polyresonance**: Primordials ar polyresonant beings, meaning their evolution is deeply connected to other kingdoms. This resonance grants them unique powers and generally exert great influence the world around them.

### Historical Significance

Primordials, through [[Bluma]] dating observations, were determined to be most influential through the [[Cel Blindbirth Line|Cel Blindbirth Line]], when [[Celia|Celia's]] overwhelming presence forced many of the Huma kingdoms to retreat underground. Upon Huma's return during the [[Line from Few]], these immense creatures are survivors of the Celia and [[Gyre Shift]]. Thus, primordials are viewed and revered by many for their power and have been featured prominently in myths and legends as a result.

### Notable Primordials

- **Alwa**: A powerful creature, claimed by [[Presceptist]] (and present day Asceptim believers), to be a demon primordial of Celia-Bluma-Natura-Huma-Spira Resonance. Alwa was said, at her zenith, to stand in each continent at once blocking out the sun at the center of the plane's atmosphere, voiding the world of light.
- **Vaosi**: [[Vaosi]]
- **Ahdom Drakes**: [[Qa'ura]], [[Kautiger]], and [[Lopali]]

Primordials are ancient, colossal creatures of immense power, representing the raw, unrefined forces of nature within the Toman Ecoss. These entities are deeply connected to the fundamental elements and energies of the universe, embodying the untamed and chaotic aspects of existence. Primordials often possess resonance, a deep connection to the elemental or spiritual forces of the world, making them forces to be reckoned with in both physical and metaphysical realms.

### Characteristics

- **Size and Power**: Primordials are typically massive in size, with abilities that surpass those of ordinary creatures. They are often associated with a particular element or force, which they can control or embody.
- **Resonance**: Many Primordials are resonant beings, meaning they are deeply connected to the elemental or spiritual forces of the universe. This resonance grants them extraordinary powers and influences the world around them.
- **Role in the Toman Ecoss**: Primordials are often seen as both protectors and destroyers, depending on their nature and the context of their interactions with other beings. They play a significant role in shaping the world, especially during times of great upheaval or transformation.

### Historical Significance

Primordials were particularly influential during the **[[Cel Blindbirth Line|Cel Blindbirth Line]]**, when their overwhelming presence forced many of the Huma Kingdoms to retreat underground. The immense power and destructive potential of Primordials have made them figures of fear and reverence in various cultures, often featuring prominently in myths and legends.

### Notable Primordials

- **Alwa**: A Celia Primordial from the **[[Cel Blindbirth Line|Cel Blindbirth Line]]**, Alwa was a massive and terrifying creature known for her desire to consume and destroy nature. Her body was so large that it spanned multiple continents, and her presence was enough to block out the sun in certain regions. Alwa's influence was so profound that the Imaan Plane **[[Gaia]]** was formed on top of her body, feeding off the sun's direct light.
