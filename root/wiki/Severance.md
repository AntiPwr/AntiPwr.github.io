# Severance

<img src="wiki_images/Severance.png"><i></i></img>

**Severance** is any spiritually significant act that causes an individual soul to detach from the influence of another's will. This process can take many forms—ritual, revelation, sacrifice, or confrontation—and is often required to restore autonomy to those who have been spiritually bound, controlled, or corrupted.

Severance is central to the metaphysics of Toma, representing the reclaiming of selfhood and the breaking of spiritual or mental bonds. It may be invoked to end the effects of possession, mind control, parasitic influence, or any condition where a character's will is not their own.

## Examples of Severance

- Self-severance, in which a portion of one's own will is deliberately and permanently cut away.
- Soul-severance, or [[Mixture Death]].

## Significance


## Self-Severance


Self-severance is a rare and profound form of severance in which an individual deliberately cuts away a portion of their own will, rather than breaking free from another's influence. This act is often undertaken to escape unbearable spiritual bonds, to atone for a grave transgression, or to prevent one's own will from being used as a weapon against others.

(For example, the [[Pith Mechanic (Artificer Specialty)]] is known for practicing self-severance.)

When self-severance occurs, the severed portion of will is permanently lost. The individual may experience a lasting sense of emptiness, diminished drive, or a fundamental change in personality. While self-severance can restore autonomy or prevent harm, it always comes at the cost of something essential within the self—an act of sacrifice that cannot be undone.

This form of severance is viewed with awe and caution in Toma's metaphysics, as it represents both the ultimate assertion of agency and a permanent diminishment of the soul.

## Soul-Severance

Soul-severance is the separation of the soul from matter—an event that marks the end of a soul's connection to the physical world, but not necessarily the end of the soul itself. This process is most often associated with [[Mixture Death]], an impermanent death in which the soul departs from the body but may continue its journey elsewhere, such as in the Soul Fields or through cycles of rebirth. Unlike self-severance, which is a deliberate act of will, soul-severance is typically involuntary and represents a transition rather than a final conclusion. In Toman metaphysics, soul-severance is a necessary part of the cycle of existence, allowing for transformation, migration, or renewal of the soul beyond its current form.

Severance is both a narrative and mechanical tool, allowing characters to reclaim their identity and resist forces that would subsume their will. It is often a turning point in a character's journey, marking the restoration of independence and the end of spiritual domination.
