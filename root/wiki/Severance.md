**Severance** is any spiritually significant act that causes an individual soul to detach from the influence of another's will. This process can take many forms—ritual, revelation, sacrifice, or confrontation—and is often required to restore autonomy to those who have been spiritually bound, controlled, or corrupted.

Severance is central to the metaphysics of Toma, representing the reclaiming of selfhood and the breaking of spiritual or mental bonds. It may be invoked to end the effects of possession, mind control, parasitic influence, or any condition where a character's will is not their own.

## Examples of Severance

- Breaking free from a psychic parasite or hive-mind.
- Rituals to end the effects of Celia Inoculation or Shadow Natura.
- Acts of willpower or belief that restore a character's autonomy.

## Significance

Severance is both a narrative and mechanical tool, allowing characters to reclaim their identity and resist forces that would subsume their will. It is often a turning point in a character's journey, marking the restoration of independence and the end of spiritual domination.
