# 212 Shift

The **212 Shift** is a pivotal event in the history of the [[Tildohsi Partition]] and the [[Clutched Forest]]. It marks the moment when [[Avan Persevet]], continental enemy of the Deltan-state and leader of the Partition, outmaneuvered the imperial army of the [[Chain of Delta]], the [[Kleznit Advance]], by luring them into the Clutched Forest. The event is named for the 212 units of [[therium]] reclaimed from destroyed [[Willed-Mecha]] and [[automata]] during the battle, with the aid of the forest's guardian, [[Sevfres]].

## Background

The 212 Shift occurred after Avan Persevet, exiled from [[Delta]] for uniting people against the state, found refuge in the Clutched Forest with a group of followers. The Chain of Delta, seeking to eliminate Avan and his movement, dispatched an imperial army of [[Kleznit]]—primarily Willed-Mecha created in [[Rasm]]—toward the forest. Avan, forewarned, used the forest's terrain and the territorial nature of [[Sevfres]] to his advantage.

## The Event

Willed-Mecha were the first to enter the forest, followed by [[Huma]] fighters. The Chain's army surrounded the western forest line, prepared to prevent any escape. However, Avan's strategy relied on the destructive power of Sevfres, a powerful entity bound to the Clutched Forest. As the army advanced, Sevfres destroyed the Willed-Mecha and many of their operators. Huma soldiers who attempted to flee were shot by their own side—a brutal tactic of the Chain to punish deserters. Some Chain-affiliated Huma soldiers were also taken hostage by the Partition.

## Aftermath

The 212 Shift is celebrated by the Tildohsi people as a turning point that secured their autonomy and allowed them to reclaim valuable therium from the wreckage of automata and Willed-Mecha. The event is not recognized by the Chain of Delta, but it remains a foundational story of resistance and survival for the Partition.
