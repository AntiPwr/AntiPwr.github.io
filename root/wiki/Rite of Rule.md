_"If you do not understand that which you rule, you do not rule anything at all."_ — Ophelia Necesse

The Rite of Rule is a [[Rites of Huma|Rite of Huma]] that defines leadership not as ownership, but as a responsibility that demands understanding, faith, and active engagement. It asserts that those in power must be deeply connected to the people they govern, ensuring that leadership is never detached from the reality of those it serves.

## Governance Through Connection

The Rite of Rule states that rulers cannot govern from a place of isolation. A leader must experience the world through the eyes of their people, actively engaging with the faith and perspectives of those under their influence. This principle prevents governance from becoming stagnant or dictatorial, reinforcing the idea that authority must be earned and continuously reaffirmed.

This belief is reflected in Sol Unita’s political structure, where leadership is not a permanent right but a role that must be actively maintained. Leaders, including monarchs, government officials, and business heads, are expected to regularly prove their worth through direct engagement with the population.

## Ophelia Necesse and the Rite of Rule

One of the most well-known adherents to this rite is [[Ophelia Necesse]], who follows its principles through her unguarded walks through [[Scender]]. Disguised and without protection, she ventures into the city to speak with citizens directly, listening to their concerns and learning from their struggles. These walks, often referred to as "the pilgrimage within one's own domain," are a direct expression of the Rite of Rule.

Citizens who encounter Ophelia during these walks often describe strange [[Source Surges|belief events]], where their emotions and clarity of thought are subtly influenced. Whether this is a psychological phenomenon or an aspect of her connection to the divine remains a topic of speculation.

## Expectations of Authority

The Rite of Rule applies beyond royalty and government officials. Any position of leadership—whether in politics, business, or craft—must adhere to its principles. The greater one’s influence, the greater the expectation to listen, learn, and embody the needs of those they oversee.

This manifests in multiple ways:

- Monarchs must be accessible to their people, ensuring that laws reflect societal needs rather than personal ambitions.
- Government officials must regularly engage with citizens, preventing bureaucratic stagnation.
- Business leaders must prioritize the well-being of their workers and consumers, ensuring that economic growth does not come at the expense of societal harmony.
- Artisans and scholars must pass on knowledge in a way that honors their students, treating mentorship as an exchange rather than a hierarchy.

## The Balance Between Power and Responsibility

The Rite of Rule ensures that leadership remains fluid and adaptable. Those in power must continuously demonstrate their relevance and effectiveness, preventing systems of governance from becoming rigid or corrupt. If a ruler or leader loses touch with the people, they are expected to either reform or relinquish their position, often leading to transitions in power through the [[Rite of Transference]].

While it is a guiding principle in Sol Unita, interpretations of the Rite of Rule can vary between different sancts. Some, like [[Ballast Sanct]], view it as a duty to uphold religious authority, while others, like [[Necesse Sanct]], see it as a means of ensuring personal enlightenment through governance.

Regardless of interpretation, the Rite of Rule remains one of the most defining principles of leadership within Sol Unita, ensuring that power is not a privilege, but an ever-renewing responsibility.
