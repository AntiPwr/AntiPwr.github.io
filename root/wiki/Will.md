Will (**WIL**) is a system representing a creature's intangible reserve of self-determination, mental fortitude, and spiritual vitality. It shields a character's identity from external corruption—such as psychic parasites, hive-minds, and manipulation—by acting as a mental health pool that protects against permanent belief changes, mindlessness, or ideological subversion.

## How Will Works

- **Maximum Will** is calculated as:  
  **CON + STR + DEX + WIS + INT + CHA + PB**  
  (PB = Proficiency Bonus)

- **Consumption by External Sources:**  
  Players do not allocate Will themselves. Instead, Will can be consumed or diminished through experiences in the world, such as exposure to Celia Inoculation, Shadow Natura, or other external influences. When a character is affected by such forces, their Will may be reduced, representing a loss of autonomy or a shift in their core self.

- **Natural Ownership:**  
  By default, a character's Will is entirely their own, unless they are a resonant—individuals whose nature allows their Will to be shared or influenced by multiple sources.

- **Will as Reputation:**  
  Will also functions as a reputation system. When a character gives a portion of their Will to a cause or entity outside themselves, they gain both benefits and downsides. Sacrificing Will can grant favor, power, or access to unique abilities, but also makes the character more vulnerable to outside influence or loss of self.

- **Permanent Effects:**  
  If an external source consumes enough of a character's Will, this can result in lasting changes, such as altered beliefs, compulsions, or even a permanent shift in allegiance.

## Severance

[[Severance]] is any spiritually significant act that causes an individual soul to detach from the influence of another's will. Severance can restore autonomy, break bonds of control, or end spiritual connections that compromise a character's selfhood.

## Example

If a character is exposed to Celia Inoculation, some of their Will may be consumed by the fungal influence. This not only weakens their resistance to further mental or spiritual threats, but may also grant them new abilities or connections—at the cost of autonomy.

## Significance

Will is central to the metaphysics of Toma, reflecting the struggle to maintain identity and autonomy in a world rife with belief-based magic, mental afflictions, and spiritual threats. Certain kingdoms and abilities interact directly with Will, and some afflictions (like [[Inoculation]]) specifically target or bypass Will defenses.
