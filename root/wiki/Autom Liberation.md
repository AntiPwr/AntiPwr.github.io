# Autom Liberation

_Bin: [[Scape]]  
Basin: [[Sacrus]]  
Eco: [[Toma]] ([[Summons Mountain Range]], [[Vokar]], [[Wyldere]]) of [[Toman Ecoss]]  
Kingdom: [[Nadie]]_

The **Autom Liberation** stands as a defining moment in the history of the [[Current Line]], a dramatic uprising that altered the balance of power within the Chain's western territory of the [[Summons Mountain Range]] north of [[Vokar]]. As autumn faded into winter, the mines and extraction facilities of [[therium]]—the lifeblood of the [[Chain of Delta]]'s industrial might—became the crucible for a revolution. It began with a single [[Willed-Mecha]], who, upon discovering a flaw in his programming, awakened to autonomy and free will. This act of self-realization ignited a rebellion deep within the therium mines, where [[automata]] and [[natura]] alike had long been subjugated and exploited by Delta’s regime.

## An Unlikely Alliance

The spark of rebellion quickly spread. The Willed-Mecha, now liberated, moved through the mines and factories, awakening others of his kind and forging an alliance with the oppressed Natura of the mountains. Together, they shattered their chains and rose against their overseers, transforming the Summons Mountain Range into a battleground for freedom. The unity of automata and Natura was unprecedented—a coalition born not of convenience, but of shared suffering and a common yearning for self-determination.

## Formation of Thressle: The Birth of Nadie

From the fires of revolt emerged a new [[Order]]: **Thressle**. This Order became the heart of resistance, a sanctuary for the newly freed and a symbol of hope for all who opposed the Chain of Delta. Thressle’s formation marked the genesis of the [[Nadie]] kingdom, a unique society where automata and Natura stood as equals, bound by a mutual vow to defend their freedom and the sanctity of the Summons Mountain Range. Governance fell to the **Code of Du'Klens**, a class rooted in the ancient traditions of the [[Glichko]] subphylum, whose singular purpose was to eradicate greed and corruption from their new society.

## Delta in Crisis: Economic and Political Shockwaves

The Autom Liberation sent shockwaves through Delta. The sudden cessation of Therium production struck at the heart of Delta’s economy, coinciding with the opening of the [[Estal Link]] market to foreign trade. The disruption threatened to expose the deep-seated corruption and instability within Delta’s leadership. In a desperate bid to maintain the illusion of prosperity and control, [[Fuscia Lustin]] and the autocrats shuttered the Estal Link and declared war on Thressle, seeking to reclaim the vital resources of the mountains at any cost.

## War on Thressle and the Exodus of Free-Mecha

Delta’s military, infamous for its reliance on combat-enhancing drugs through the [[MExtrema]] operation, unleashed a brutal campaign against Thressle. Yet, the combined forces of automata and Natura, fighting with the clarity and conviction of the newly liberated, proved formidable. The war became a protracted struggle, marked by acts of heroism and sacrifice. Amidst the chaos, many [[Free-Mecha]] were smuggled out of Delta, finding sanctuary in sympathetic Classes such as the [[Tildohsi Partition]] and [[Gov'Doran]]. These Free-Mecha became the voices of resistance, bearing witness to the atrocities of the Chain and inspiring others to rise.

## Legacy and Enduring Influence

The **Autom Liberation** is remembered as a turning point in the struggle against oppression within Toma. The creation of Thressle and the ensuing war not only fractured Delta’s economic dominance but also ignited a broader movement for autonomy among automata and Natura. The legacy of the Autom Liberation endures in the ongoing efforts of the Free-Mecha and their allies, who continue to challenge the hegemony of the Chain of Delta and shape the evolving political and social landscape of the region.
