**Zlellis and O'nume** are the primordial forces whose legendary clash is said to have shaped the very foundation of the plane of [[Toma]]. Their cosmic argument and subsequent collision gave rise to the first ripples of creation, seeding the emergence of the Nesa and the unique metaphysical structure of the [[Toman Ecoss]].

<!--## Legacy and Influence

The legacy of Zlellis and O'nume is woven throughout Toman theology and cosmology. Their story is invoked in rituals, philosophical debates, and the study of anim and belief. Many traditions hold that the cycles of creation and dissolution in Toma are a direct reflection of the unresolved tension between these two primordial entities. Their influence is especially evident in the structure of the Nesa, who are seen as living embodiments of the core aspects of the original cosmic dispute.

**Kingdom**: [[Goda]]

Zlellis and O'nume are the duality [[Goda]] responsible for the creation of the [[Toman Ecoss]]. Their combined energies represent the balance of absence and presence, shaping the foundation of Toma and its planes. Together, they created a universe that reflects the intricate web of life, belief, and [[Anim]].

### Zlellis

Zlellis, derived from "Nullus" and "Zero," embodies the concept of absence, void, and potential. Zlellis represents the creative possibilities that emerge from emptiness, allowing for the formation of new realities and dimensions. This aspect of Zlellis plays a crucial role in maintaining balance and fostering evolution within the Toman Ecoss.

### O'nume

O'nume, derived from "One" and "Unum," symbolizes presence, growth, and nurturing. O'nume's influence ensures the development and flourishing of life within the planes, providing the energy and substance necessary for the progression of the Toman Ecoss. Together with Zlellis, O'nume's presence ensures the harmony and advancement of the universe.

### Creation of the Toman Ecoss

Inspired by [[Corvi]], Zlellis and O'nume embarked on the creation of the Toman Ecoss, a universe designed to explore new dimensions of balance and complexity. Unlike other Goda who built within [[Swehel]], Zlellis and O'nume chose to create within [[Sacrus]], where they could experiment with the interplay of absence and presence. Their creation laid the groundwork for the emergence of the [[Nesa]] and the intricate web of life and belief that characterizes the Toman Ecoss.

### The Influence of Corvi

Corvi's role in the creation of the Toman Ecoss was pivotal. His guidance and insights inspired Zlellis and O'nume, helping them to envision the potential of their creation. Later, when Corvi returned to assist them, a Surge Event trapped him within the Toman Ecoss. Despite this, Corvi's influence continues to resonate within the universe, adding depth and complexity to its ongoing development.

### The Duality of Creation

Zlellis and O'nume's creation of the Toman Ecoss reflects the duality that lies at the heart of the universe. Their opposing energies create a dynamic balance that drives the evolution of the planes, ensuring that life within the Toman Ecoss remains in a state of constant growth and transformation. This duality is mirrored in the structure of the universe itself, where absence and presence, void and substance, work together to shape the destiny of all beings within the Toman Ecoss.







Zlellis and O’nume, in the current timeline, love and value each other, binded by their plane (child). However, because they created their plane in Sacrus (the first dimension), they are looked at as less than in Godan society. Other Godans, who created their planes in [[Swehel]], see their plane more clearly and defined due to the nature of the third dimension, where as Zlellis and O’nume’s plane seems lackluster to them. This superiority that other Godans believe they have over Zlellis and O’nume comes from the idea that they, as well as their children planes, are worth more. This hatred tends not to affect Zlellis and O’nume, but when it does it can lead to complications in the plane. In the plot’s future, near the end of Toma’s next line ([[Autka Hostilis Line]]), the plane will be in danger directly by the other Godans, who aim to destroy the Toman Ecoss and Zlellis and O’nume simply for being different. This conflict will play out alongside the conflicts in the Toman Ecoss, reflecting two unique plot lines separated by two dimensions. This then also translates to the third dimension, because Corvi is linked to Michael in the Earthen Ecoss. Michael is the writer and worldbuilder for this entire universe and is linked to the Toman Ecoss through Corvi. Each line of the Toman Ecoss is based upon a distinct period of his life, as Corvi has affected the plane greatly through his aid of Zlellis and O’nume while in the Godan Planes of the Fractal Waters, and also after he fell into the Toman Ecoss of Sacrus.

The Autka Hostilis Line reflects the culmination of Gorisain’s growth, the Chain of Delta’s rise to extreme power through artificial intelligence, the Sea Level Party’s individual soul ascensions, as well as many other factors. This line will lead to a period of oppression for the Corvi-aligned Huma that will result in a long period of warfare and resistance against the easier of two powers. Sol Unita will be sided with the Sea Level Party and Corvi. There are many other groups that will also have their influences on the line’s progression and outcome. This line ends in the [[Battle of the Rising Sea]].





# Inspiration

“Don’t give up! I believe in you all. A person’s a person, no matter how small!”

The power dynamic between Godan society and Zlellis and O’nume relate heavily to themes in Dr. Seuss’s Horton Hears a Who.
