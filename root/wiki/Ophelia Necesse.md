**Ophelia Necesse**, also known as the Fallen Apostle, is the reigning queen of [[Scender]] in the [[Current Line]]. As the queen, officially known as the [[Primus Inter Sancta]], of [[Sol Unita]], she balances the royal sancts in their development of faith, technological advancement, and governance. Her rule is defined by her desire to reduce human suffering through technology, specifically noted for her devisive takes on implantation, a vision that has earned her both devotion from her people, criticism from political adversaries, and economic growth bound to be acknowledged globally.


## Cyberqueen

Ophelia is a pioneer of transhumanist augmentation, gradually integrating cybernetic enhancements into her body and mind, spreading to her people through perceived signs of enlightenment and alignment with Asceptim ideals of ascension. Though she remains predominantly Huma, her transformation continues, bringing her closer to what  a technological singularity.

<!-- Her greatest fear is losing her humanity, becoming something monstrous—something that preys on her own people, something that sees ascension as an individual goal as opposed to a collective goal. She struggles with the paradox of progress, knowing that the further she pushes technological evolution, the more she risks detachment from those she governs. -->

<!-- ## Therium-Bound

Ophelia aims to be deeply invested in the Therium trade, a resource with immense transformative potential. The [[Chain of Delta]] controls most of the known Therium deposits, forcing Sol Unita to conduct government-sanctioned expeditions into uncharted regions of [[Sancta]] in search of alternative sources.

While Therium mining is strictly regulated, growing unrest exists among Scender’s population. Many believe the substance should be more accessible, and black-market trades continue to complicate her policies.

## Queen’s Conflict: Ascension for All?

Ophelia preaches that ascension is achievable for all, but she increasingly questions this belief. The [[Ceremony of His Eye]] reinforces doubts—suggesting that ascension may be selective, rather than a universal fate.

Despite these concerns, she remains dedicated to Sol Unita’s teachings. However, the burden of her position and the weight of these contradictions take a toll on her mental health, a struggle she conceals from the public. -->

## Rite of Rule Interpretation

Ophelia interprets the [[Rites of Huma#Rite of Rule|Rite of Rule]] in a unique way, resulting in her engaging with the people by walking through the streets of Scender and Southcatch in disguise, without guards or an entourage. These pilgrimages allow her to directly understand the lives of her people, reinforcing the belief that no Huma is above another, not even the queen. 

<!--Those who encounter her during these walks sometimes describe a mysterious, life-changing conversational experience. This phenomenon, known as Flow State, is often unexplainable to non-magic users, but those capable describe it as a subtle psychic or divine interaction that influences one's emotions, critical thinking, and directional growth. Though rarely spoken of, the changes in these individuals' lives afterward are often undeniable.-->

## Soft Fall Policy

Ophelia’s Soft Fall Policy is rooted in her deep study of the [[War of Conclusions]], particularly the mercy shown to the defeated [[Branches of Concordia|Concordians]] by the [[Presceptists]]. She believes in second chances and the importance of redemption over annihilation.

<!-- The [[Chain of Delta]] condemns this policy, as seen with the Hypri Highcourt Summits, claiming it as a weakness. They frequently exploit Sol Unita’s willingness to rehabilitate outsiders, using it as an opportunity for infiltration, insurgent funding, and ideological subversion. Despite these criticisms, Ophelia refuses to abandon her belief in mercy as a foundation for progress. -->

<!-- ## Arachnid Arm: Queen’s Chord

Ophelia possesses a cybernetic appendage known as the [[Queen’s Chord]], a multi-jointed, arachnid-like limb that extends from a mechanized backplate.

- The Queen’s Chord functions as both a mobility tool and sensory enhancement, allowing her to anchor herself to structures or suspend herself in midair.
- Through it, she creates a resonant web—an anima network that tracks the belief energy of those around her.
- She can "play" the web, causing Spira vibrations to produce acoustic melodies, which resonate through Scender like an ambient hymn.

When detached, the Queen’s Chord remains suspended, leaving her floating only by the energy of her web. The structure of the web is organic, resembling bioluminescent vines that produce soft, tropical tones when strummed. -->

## Struggles With Other Royal Sancts

Ophelia is perceived as weak by members of [[Ballast Sanct]] and [[Dianett Sanct]], who view her reliance on diplomacy as ineffective.

- Ballast Sanct remains deeply conservative, believing in ascension through structured devotion. They often clash with Ophelia’s technological leanings.
- Dianett Sanct, with its focus on genetic purity, sees her cybernetic enhancements as unnatural.
- Hiamoe Sanct is more accepting but remains largely neutral, unwilling to fully align with her progressive policies.

Since her rise to this position, political friction between the Sancts has increased due to a fallout of believers in traditional values promoted. The Necesse Sanct is noticeably changing alongside Ophelia Necesse's guidance, gradually altering their perspective on individual ascension to better align with the pragmatism and utilitarianism of her belief felt through prosperity in all social classes.

## Rise To Power

Ophelia became Queen of Scender after the death of Cassandra Ballast and the brief rule of Lain Ballast. Her rise came years after the War of Conclusions, during a time of deep reform known as the [[Sol Reformation]].

Before her involvement with royalty, Ophelia led a religious movement advocating for a more inclusive interpretation of [[Asceptim]], in respect to leadership, and a greater focus on reduction of planar suffering. Her work caught the attention of the [[Necesse Sanct]], who recognized her influence and societal impact in the lower classes.

<!-- Her rule, and the evolution of Scender, stand as a global counterweight to the oppression of the [[Chain of Delta]]. Under her leadership, Scender has flourished, but the pressures of governance continue to test her resolve.-->
