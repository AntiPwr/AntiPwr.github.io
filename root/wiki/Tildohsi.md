**Tildohsi** is a city located in the western reaches of the [[Clutched Forest]], serving as the capital and central [[Order]] of the [[Tildohsi Partition]] Class. The city is a testament to the resilience and ingenuity of its inhabitants, who have adapted to life in a region defined by both natural abundance and constant threat. Tildohsi is a hub of governance, culture, and magical innovation, where the ruling population of [[Huma]] and [[Automata]] work in close cooperation with [[Ferra]] and [[Celia]] to maintain a symbiotic society. The city’s survival and prosperity are closely tied to its mastery of sound magic and its ability to remain hidden from the dangers that lurk within the forest, most notably the enigmatic hand known as [[Sevfres]].

## Main Section

Tildohsi’s location within the Clutched Forest provides both protection and challenge. The dense, resource-rich woodland is a natural barrier against outside threats, but it is also home to the powerful and unpredictable entity known as [[Sevfres]]. The city’s architecture and daily life are shaped by the need for secrecy and silence; buildings are often soundproofed, and communication is carefully managed to avoid drawing the attention of Sevfres. This necessity has led to the development of advanced sound magic and innovative methods of concealment, making Tildohsi a center for magical research and practice.

The city is governed by a council that represents the diverse populations of Huma, Automata, Ferra, and Celia. This inclusive approach to governance fosters a sense of unity and shared purpose, allowing Tildohsi to thrive despite the constant dangers of its environment. The city’s economy is based on a combination of resource management, magical innovation, and trade with neighboring regions, all carefully balanced to maintain autonomy and security.

Tildohsi’s culture is deeply influenced by its history of resistance and adaptation. The city’s residents take pride in their ability to survive and prosper in a hostile environment, and this spirit of resilience is reflected in their art, traditions, and communal life. The mastery of sound magic is not only a practical necessity but also a source of cultural identity and pride.
