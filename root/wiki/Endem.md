# Endem

**Endem** is the subterranean world of [[Toma]], consisting of sprawling caverns that connect the major continents. During the [[Cel Blindbirth Line]], Huma's history was shrouded in cataclysm as all Huma were forced into Endem as other kingdoms conquered the above ground. By the end of the line, Huma population dropped to just three percent of its original number.
