**Artifact**

The Rite of Passage is a [[Rites of Huma|Rite of Huma]] considered to be the original [[Ester Slate]], created by [[Asath]].It is the most revered artifact in Asceptim faith, holding profound spiritual significance for [[Sol Unita]] and its followers.

## Description

The Rite of Passage is a smooth, stone-like [[Ester Slate]], covered in intricate engravings that emit a faint, mystical glow when held. Unlike other slates, which engage each sense separately, the Rite of Passage merges all senses into one ultra-sense, allowing the observer to experience total understanding and knowledge in a singular moment.

Those who witness the engravings describe an overwhelming clarity of thought and purpose. It is said to be an experience beyond words—an encounter with pure, unfiltered enlightenment.


## Cultural Significance

The Rite of Passage is not merely a relic but a living doctrine that shapes both spiritual belief and political governance. It serves as the basis of all Asceptim faith, dictating that all [[Huma]] must strive for ascension into **Sol Proscima**, a higher plane of existence.

It is central to major religious ceremonies, including the [[Ceremony of His Eye]], where chosen followers undergo ritualistic blinding as a test of faith. Its teachings influence daily life, legal systems, and governance, ensuring that all paths within Sol Unita lead toward spiritual elevation.

## Role in Asceptim

The Rite of Passage is considered the highest truth—an unaltered, divine record that cannot be misinterpreted. It is the origin of all other rites, including the [[Rite of Rule]], which dictates leadership, and the [[Rite of Transference]], which ensures rulers relinquish power when a superior vision emerges.

As the purest manifestation of Goda wisdom, it remains a focal point of faith, law, and governance within Sol Unita.

## Preservation and Legacy

The Rite of Passage is preserved in [[Scender]], housed within a sacred vault, accessible only during select rituals. Despite its seclusion, its presence is deeply felt throughout all aspects of society—a constant reminder of the ultimate goal of ascension.

The experience of viewing the Rite of Passage is described as transcendent, unlike any other slate. Most other [[Ester Slates]] separate the senses, but this one blends them into an ultra-sense, revealing total clarity and divine understanding in an instant.

It is the first step toward ascension—the beginning of all knowledge, and the guiding light of Sol Unita.
