**Bin**: [[Scape]]

**Eco**: [[Scape (TTRPG)/1 Purpose Taxonomy/Complete Taxonomy/02 Eco/01 Toman Ecoss/02 Toma/Toma]] (**Babadoo Slim**) of [[Toman Ecoss]]

**Babadoo Slim** is a lush, tropical isle, home to [[New Badaba]] and ruled by the [[Hacienda Band]]. The island is known for its vibrant and often dangerous ecosystem, where fertile lands meet primal, untamed forces. The island's economy revolves around its agricultural resources, the poaching of exotic creatures, and illegal gambling and trade operations that thrive under the control of the Hacienda Band.

### Ecology and the Threat of Vaosi

One of the island's most dangerous and revered creatures is **[[Vaosi]]**, the last known [[Allodile]]—a massive, leaping [[Primordial]] that roams the island and occasionally the surrounding waters. Vaosi is unique in his resonance with salt, algae, and the [[Sea of Presence]]. During his hibernation cycles, salt from the Sea of Absence encrusts his body, protecting him and aiding his slow evolution. His infrequent feeding—only once every two months—makes his movements difficult to track, adding to the legend surrounding him. While no confirmed reports exist of Vaosi attacking Huma, his status as a Primordial and his massive size make him a constant threat to the people of New Badaba.

Vaosi's hibernation and feeding cycles have deeply spiritual and existential significance for the island's inhabitants. He represents the last vestige of an ancient world, a reminder that despite human expansion and control, primal forces still dominate much of Babadoo Slim. The Hacienda Band continually tracks Vaosi's movements, fearing the destruction he could unleash on their operations, while others revere him as a symbol of the island’s untamed spirit.

### Economy and Governance

Babadoo Slim's economy is tied to both its rich natural resources and its dark undercurrent of illegal activities. New Badaba, the main settlement on the island, operates as a hub for agriculture and illicit trade, governed by the Hacienda Band. They profit primarily from the capture and sale of exotic creatures, especially Primordials, which are highly sought after in markets across [[Scape (TTRPG)/1 Purpose Taxonomy/Complete Taxonomy/02 Eco/01 Toman Ecoss/02 Toma/Toma]]. This trade is dangerous and heavily regulated by external authorities, which often place the Hacienda Band at odds with external powers seeking to end their poaching and black-market dealings.

The Hacienda Band maintains a public distance from the pirate factions that inhabit New Badaba, yet they covertly rely on them to fuel their economy. Pirates serve as unofficial enforcers and smugglers, their presence ensuring that the illegal aspects of New Badaba’s economy remain profitable. Agriculture, particularly fruit cultivation in the fertile lands west of New Badaba, provides a legitimate front for the island’s darker dealings.

### Cultural and Spiritual Significance

Babadoo Slim is more than just an island of resources and danger; it holds deep spiritual meaning for those who inhabit it. The people of New Badaba, particularly the New World [[Simi]], have developed a belief system around the cycle of life, death, and renewal, heavily influenced by Pria and their reverence for nature’s primal forces. The existence of Vaosi as a powerful Primordial also plays into this belief, with some seeing him as a force of nature that must be respected, if not feared.

The island is also home to lingering practices of **[[Oshe]]**, a remnant of the **[[Ashprahm]]** religion once brought by the **[[Tayim Trade Republic]]**. This mix of beliefs creates a complex spiritual landscape, where the reverence for the natural world and primal forces coexists with occult practices that still linger from the island’s imperial past.

### Inspiration

Babadoo Slim draws from the lush, tropical environments of **Cuba** and **inland tropical Mexico**, where rich ecosystems meet the remnants of colonialism and resistance. The island blends the beauty of a fertile paradise with the undercurrent of danger and hidden threats, much like the history of tropical regions that were exploited for their natural resources while resisting external control. Vaosi, the Allodile, represents the primal forces that still dominate these lands, despite the best efforts of human expansion and control.
