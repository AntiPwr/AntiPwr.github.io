# Discovery Inspiration

**Discovery Inspiration** is a system that replaces traditional DMG Inspiration. By achieving personal milestones, uncovering truths, or fulfilling goals, players earn dice of varying sizes (D4 to D20). Lesser dice (D4â€“D12) resemble Bardic Inspiration and must be used quickly, while a D20 represents a major milestone and can be saved between sessions.
