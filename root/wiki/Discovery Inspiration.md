# Discovery Inspiration

**Discovery Inspiration** is a system that replaces traditional DMG Inspiration. By achieving personal milestones, uncovering truths, connections to reality, or fulfilling goals, players earn dice of varying sizes (D4 to D20). Lesser dice (D4â€“D12) resemble Bardic Inspiration and must be used quickly, while a D20 represents a major milestone and can be saved between sessions.

## How It Works

- **Earning Inspiration:**  
  Players receive Discovery Inspiration dice for significant achievements, discoveries, or roleplay moments.
- **Dice Sizes:**  
  - D4 to D12: Minor to moderate discoveries or accomplishments. These must be used soon after being awarded.
  - D20: Major milestones or breakthroughs. These can be retained between sessions.
- **Usage:**  
  Discovery Inspiration dice can be added to ability checks, attack rolls, or saving throws.

## Purpose

This system encourages exploration, personal growth, and creative problem-solving, rewarding players for engaging deeply with the world and their characters' stories.

Discover Surge

Discovery Inspiration occurs when a player, through their passionate approach to character development and roleplay, can gain in-game benefits as their character fulfills their destiny. This can be thought of as a Universal Karma system and can be referred to as a discovery surge. Discovery Surges or the Discovery Inspiration system, acts as an expanded inspiration system that will be replacing the DMG Inspiration System.

When a Discovery Surge occurs, I will alert the player that they receive one die, between a D4 and a D20 as inspiration for uncovering a truth of the world, fulfilling an oath or bond, completing a personal goal, or other similar milestones. Where this system diverges from the traditional one is with the D20 and the lesser die being treated differently. The D20 is treated as a typical, permanent inspiration that can be saved between sessions. The lesser die, which are likely to be handed out more commonly, cannot be saved between sessions and are instead treated like Bardic Inspiration Dice, where you may add to any roll, instead of gaining advantage as you would normally. It should also be noted that the traditional D20 is reflective of achieving a character milestone, whereas the lesser die are more reflective of a player promoting roleplay or immersion up to the point of achieving a character milestone. Lesser discovery surges can be thought of as the preliminary steps to a greater goal or milestone.

*I may choose to allow certain lesser discovery die to roll over to the next session depending on the context.*

This system does not aim to add more inspiration or free rolls to the game, but rather change the composition of what was already available by delineating the DMG Inspiration System. By allowing myself to choose between a D4 and a D12 for lesser surges, I can properly rank milestones in a character's journey, as well as promote excellent pursuance of goals. Additionally, the limited use allows the lesser die values to be made up for by their increased commonality. Think of this system as a thumbs up from the DM, but also as a spiritual thumbs up system of Toma. 

#### Examples

- A player discovers an important connection between one location and another location. (D4)
- A player uncovers a mark of deception laden in the words of an official letter through their careful consideration of the context. (D6)

- A character fulfills a three-year long quest of personal importance with the aid of their party. (D20)
