**Bin**: [[Scape]]  
**Basin**: [[Sacrus]]  
**Eco**: **Soul Fields** of **[[Toman Ecoss]]**

The **Soul Fields** is a vast and ethereal plane within the **[[Toman Ecoss]]**, serving as the primary realm where **[[Spira]]** and **[[Nesa]]** exist and interact. This plane is integral to the cycle of life, death, and rebirth, acting as the medium through which souls transition and beliefs are manifested into the world.

### Terrain

The terrain of the Soul Fields bears a resemblance to that of the living Toman Planes, but with distinct differences influenced by the unique nature of this spiritual realm. The landscape is shaped by the condensed essence of **[[Soul Anatomy]]**, creating an environment that is fluid and ever-changing.

The terrain within the Soul Fields is not fixed; it shifts and evolves based on the perception of creatures in the living planes. This shifting nature is akin to a fog of war, where the boundaries and shapes of the terrain expand or contract according to the belief and perception of the beings that interact with it. For example, if a creature with weak vision perceives the Soul Fields, the area within their limited sight is the extent to which Spira can sense belief within that region.

### Function and Dynamics

The Soul Fields serve as the primary domain for Spira, who reside here until they are released by **[[Never]]**, the Arbiter of Souls, into the control of **[[Behinyu]]**. Behinyu then directs them to interact with the living Toman Planes. The plane acts as a reservoir of souls, where they await the flow of **[[Anim]]** to guide them towards new lives or to influence existing beings in the material world.

### Influence on the Living Planes

The Soul Fields have a profound influence on the living planes, especially in how they interact with the flow of belief and anima. Spira within the Soul Fields can affect the dreams, actions, and beliefs of living creatures, subtly guiding them or, in some cases, directly intervening in their lives. The perception of the Soul Fields by the living beings directly impacts the shape and scope of this plane, making it a dynamic and responsive environment.

### The Role of Nesa

Nesa, powerful entities within the Soul Fields, play a crucial role in maintaining the balance between life and death. They oversee the movement of Spira and ensure that the flow of souls is aligned with the natural rhythms of the universe. The presence of Nesa adds a layer of complexity to the Soul Fields, as they can exert their influence over specific regions or Spira, shaping the plane in accordance with their will.

### Connection to the In-between

The Soul Fields are intricately connected to the **[[In-between]]**, the medium through which creatures of the Toman Ecoss interact with the Imaan Planes and other realms. The In-between serves as the conduit for Spira to travel between the Soul Fields and the living planes, carrying belief and anima across the different layers of existence.

### Legacy and Significance

The Soul Fields are a cornerstone of the Toman Ecoss, ensuring the continuity of life and the preservation of belief. As a realm where souls congregate and transition, the Soul Fields embody the eternal cycle of existence, influencing the material world and shaping the destiny of all creatures within the Scape. The dynamic nature of this plane reflects the ever-changing beliefs and perceptions of the living, making it a crucial element in the balance and harmony of the Toman Ecoss.
