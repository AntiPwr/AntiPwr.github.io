A **Growthmind** is a plant-based collective consciousness, similar to a hivemind, but achieved through the consumption or integration of plant growth (such as fruit, leaves, or grass). Growthminds arise when individual plants or plant-based entities share information, will, and memory, forming a unified intelligence that can govern, defend, and adapt as a single organism.

## Characteristics

- **Distributed Intelligence:** Each member contributes to and draws from the shared mind.
- **Integration:** Sentient beings can join a Growthmind by consuming or being consumed by its plant matter.
- **Governance:** Growthminds can serve as governments or social structures, as seen in the [[Usakan Growth]] under [[Sibannac]].

## Examples

- **Sibannac:** The central Growthmind of Usaka, incorporating both plant and sentient minds.
- **Leiqua:** A phylum of Bluma specializing in psychological and social integration through interest and desire.
