**Bin**: [[Scape]]  
**Basin**: [[Sacrus]]  
**Eco**: [[Scape (TTRPG)/1 Purpose Taxonomy/Complete Taxonomy/02 Eco/01 Toman Ecoss/02 Toma/Toma]] of [[Toman Ecoss]]  
**Kingdom**: [[Bluma]] and [[Ferra]]  
**Phylum**: **Preservus**

The Preservus [[Phylum]] is a significant philosophical and spiritual tradition within the Toman Ecoss, rooted in the kingdoms of [[Bluma]] and [[Ferra]]. The phylum represents a shared belief system centered on the preservation and careful management of life and natural resources. Preservus played a crucial role in the development of **[[Asceptim]]** during the early introduction of Huma to the plane.

### Core Beliefs

The Preservus phylum is defined by its focus on the sanctity of life and the importance of preserving natural balance. This belief system posits that all life forms, whether plant or animal, possess a spiritual essence that must be respected and nurtured. The followers of Preservus believe that by carefully managing the resources of the natural world, they can achieve a state of harmony and ensure the continuation of life across the Toman Ecoss.

### Connection to Gaia

Within the Bluma kingdom, a particular belief arose that one day, if plants could gather enough light from the sun, they would ascend to a form of "plant heaven." This belief was symbolically fulfilled through the **[[Imaan Plane]]** of **[[Gaia]]**, which was formed on the back of the Celia Primordial **[[Alwa]]**. Gaia became the ultimate representation of the Bluma's spiritual aspirations, embodying their hope for eternal preservation through the consumption of light. Gaia is a state of being that Bluma knows it can return to as a collective.

However, with the death of Alwa, Gaia as a formed plane fell into decline. Despite this, the spiritual legacy of Gaia and the Preservus belief continues to influence the Bluma kingdom.

### Ferraâ€™s Divergence

While the Bluma kingdom found fulfillment in the creation of Gaia, the Ferra kingdom did not receive any aid from Alwa, leading to a deep-seated resentment. This divergence in experience caused the Ferra to break away from the Preservus belief, ultimately leading to the rise of the **[[Gludestit]]** Phylum and the leadership of **[[Hidraal]]**. The Gludestit phylum embraced hoarding and control over resources, standing in stark contrast to the preservationist ideals of Preservus. From this point on, Preservus became an exclusive belief of the [[Bluma]].

### Role in Asceptim

The introduction of Huma to the Toman Ecoss and their interaction with the kingdoms of Bluma and Ferra during the **[[Line from Few|Line from Few]]** led to the formation of **[[Asceptim]]**. Asceptim was deeply influenced by the Preservus phylum, adopting its principles of careful resource management and respect for life. The blending of these beliefs with Huma's own spiritual practices resulted in the development of Asceptim as a major religious and philosophical tradition within the Toman Ecoss.

### Legacy

The Preservus phylum remains a vital part of the Toman Ecoss, continuing to influence the spiritual and cultural practices of the Bluma and Ferra kingdoms. Its emphasis on preservation and balance serves as a counterpoint to the more aggressive and hoarding tendencies of phyla like Gludestit, ensuring that the natural world is respected and maintained for future generations.
