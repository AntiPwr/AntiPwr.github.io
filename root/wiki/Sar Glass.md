**Bin**: [[Scape]]  
**Basin**: [[Sacrus]]  
**Eco**: [[Scape (TTRPG)/1 Purpose Taxonomy/Complete Taxonomy/02 Eco/01 Toman Ecoss/02 Toma/Toma]] ([[Sansari Desert]], [[Sancta]]) of [[Toman Ecoss]]

**Sar Glass** is an exceptionally stable and durable material unique to the **[[Sansari Desert]]** within the **[[Scape (TTRPG)/1 Purpose Taxonomy/Complete Taxonomy/02 Eco/01 Toman Ecoss/02 Toma/Toma]]** ecosystem. It is a foggy, translucent glass formed from the sands of the Sansari Desert, which harden into sandstone at night due to the desert's unique environmental conditions. The glass is characterized by its extreme strength and resilience, making it a vital component in the construction of many structures within the subterranean society of **[[Gnapan]]**.

### Formation Process

Sar Glass is created through a natural process where the sands of the Sansari Desert, infused with resonant energies, undergo rapid hardening when the sun sets, turning into sandstone. The **[[Na'Kali]]**, a [[Varmid]] species, have perfected the method of harvesting and refining this sandstone into Sar Glass. By chewing the sandstone with their powerful mandibles, they mold and shape it into the foggy glass that is used to construct protective domes and other vital structures within Gnapan.

### Uses in Gnapan

Sar Glass is primarily used by the Na'Kali to construct the glass-domed vaults and other essential infrastructures within **[[Gnapan]]**. These domes are designed to protect the **[[Huma]]** population, known as the **Perhim**, from the perceived dangers of the outside world, such as falling sand and natural disasters. The Perhim believe that these domes are divine gifts, crafted to keep them safe in their paradise-like existence.

In reality, Sar Glass serves the Na'Kali's purpose of maintaining control over the Perhim by confining them within a carefully controlled environment. The foggy nature of the glass ensures that the Perhim cannot see beyond their immediate surroundings, reinforcing the illusion of their self-contained society and preventing them from realizing the true extent of the Na'Kali's influence.

### Role in Asath Sanctuary

Sar Glass also plays a significant role in the construction of the **[[Asath Sanctuary]]** in **[[Sancta]]**, specifically in the creation of an underwater tunnel/bridge that runs beneath the bay. This feature allows visitors to experience an immersive view of the bay's wildlife, symbolizing a spiritual journey through water to reach enlightenment. The refined Sar Glass used in this structure enhances the spiritual and sensory experience of those who visit the sanctuary, adding a unique and profound dimension to their faith.

### Cultural Significance

To the Perhim, Sar Glass is considered sacred, a material imbued with divine protection that keeps their society safe from harm. The glass is often revered in religious ceremonies and is believed to be a physical manifestation of the gods' favor. The domes made of Sar Glass are seen as holy structures, with the Perhim attributing their survival and prosperity to the protection these domes provide.

In Sancta, the use of Sar Glass in the Asath Sanctuary reinforces its importance not just as a material of strength and resilience but also as a symbol of spiritual protection and enlightenment, connecting different regions of the Toman Ecoss through shared reverence for this unique substance.

### Role in Na'Kali Control

For the Na'Kali, Sar Glass is a critical tool in their strategy of manipulation and control. By creating a material that is both essential for survival and deeply revered, the Na'Kali ensure that the Perhim remain compliant and unaware of the true nature of their existence. The durability and fogginess of Sar Glass make it an ideal material for maintaining the illusion of safety and divinity, further solidifying the Na'Kali's dominance over the Perhim within Gnapan.
