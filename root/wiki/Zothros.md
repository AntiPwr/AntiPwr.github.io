# Zothros

**Zothros** are [[Huma]] who, through evolution or magical influence, have become more like [[Ferra]]—embracing animal instincts, forms, and behaviors. Most Zothros are quadrupedal and display powerful, bestial traits, but many can walk upright and participate in society. Zothros embody the wild side of humanity, balancing intellect with primal strength and instinct.

## Belief Systems: Primalism and Advancism

Zothros are most commonly associated with the belief system of [[Primalism]], which emphasizes a return to primal ways, tradition, and harmony with nature. Primalism is shaped by the resonance between Huma and Ferra, with Zothros embodying the wild side of humanity and valuing instinct, ancestral wisdom, and adaptation to the natural world. Primalists are wary of unchecked technological or societal advancement, focusing instead on survival, resilience, and thriving within nature's bounds.

Despite this, some Zothros—especially those with more Huma-like traits—may adopt aspects of [[Advancism]], embracing innovation, tool use, and social complexity. This creates a spectrum of beliefs within Zothros society, with many individuals and groups blending elements of both Primalism and Advancism based on their evolutionary path and environment.

Primalist Zothros are often found in wild or rural regions, serving as hunters, shamans, or defenders of tradition. Advancist-leaning Zothros may act as bridge-builders between wild and civilized societies, or as innovators who adapt technology to natural contexts. The dynamic between these belief systems contributes to the rich diversity of Zothros communities across Toma.


## Origins and Diaspora

The origin of Ferra-Huma resonance is traced to the [[Agraial Tribelands]], a region now known as the [[Agresta Jungle]] in the [[Current Line]]. This area was the cradle of mass resonance between Ferra and Huma, giving rise to the Zothros subkingdom. Since this foundational event, Zothros populations have experienced a diaspora, spreading to most major continents across Toma.
