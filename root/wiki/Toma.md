Toma is the primary plane (Eco) of the [[Toman Ecoss]], a world where the boundaries between kingdoms, belief, and geography are fluid and ever-changing. Its landscapes are shaped by the interplay of anim, death, and the collective will of its inhabitants. The formation of [[Hollow Resource|Hollow Resources]] is central to Toma's history, technology, and spiritual life. The concept of [[Metageography]]—the idea that geography itself is a product of death, belief, and transformation—defines the evolution of Toma's biomes, civilizations, and resources.

## Summary

Toma is the plane where the Scape campaigns begin. I am excited for everything to be slowly uncovered. 

## Metageography and Hollow Resources

See: [[Metageography]], [[Hollow Resource|Hollow Resources]]

Toma's geography is unique in the fact that it tends to blend and manifest in accordance to the release of anim through the decay of organic matter. And since the various kingdoms are distinct in their application and involvement in belief systems, the biomes and environments of Toma tend to paint themselves through death. This is referred to as [[Metageography]]. This death can either be continuous death, in which the environment and evolution of creatures evolves around a growing population, or occur as a large population drop, as seen with [[Wasting Event|Wasting Events]]. [[Hollow Resource|Hollow Resources]] are an example of how an ancestor's legacy and vision for the future can be carried through to a population by resources and technology.

Similarly, Toma's physical geography tends to be quite extreme, forming into natural and beautiful expanses and formations such as the expansive rainforests of [[Agresta|Agresta Jungle]], which are in partnership with the [[Swirling Sea]] and its wildlife. Or, the angled [[Summons Mountain Range]] mangled by the [[World Gyre]], spanning across [[Wyldere]].
