Toma is the primary plane (Eco) of the [[Toman Ecoss]], a world where the boundaries between kingdoms, belief, and geography are fluid and ever-changing. Its landscapes are shaped by the interplay of anim, death, and the collective will of its inhabitants. The formation of [[Hollow Resource|Hollow Resources]] is central to Toma's history, technology, and spiritual life. The concept of [[Metageography]]—the idea that geography itself is a product of death, belief, and transformation—defines the evolution of Toma's biomes, civilizations, and resources.

## Summary

Toma is the plane where the Scape campaigns begin. I am excited for everything to be slowly uncovered. 

## Metageography and Hollow Resources

See: [[Metageography]], [[Hollow Resource|Hollow Resources]]

Toma's geography is unique in that it is shaped not only by physical forces, but by the release of anim and the collective beliefs of its inhabitants. The formation of Hollow Resources is central to the world’s history, technology, and spiritual life. When large populations undergo mass or belief-charged deaths—known as Wasting Events—the resulting release of anim and belief imprints upon the land, creating potent resources that can define the future of civilizations.

Entire civilizations have risen and fallen over the control of Hollow Resources. The discovery of a rare resource like Therium can drive entire campaigns, as factions vie for its power and the spiritual economy of Toma shifts. The quest for these resources is often a grand adventure, and their use is both a blessing and a responsibility, as each carries risks and narrative consequences.

Similarly, Toma's physical geography tends to be quite extreme, forming into natural and beautiful expanses and formations such as the expansive rainforests of [[Agresta|Agresta Jungle]], which are in partnership with the [[Swirling Sea]] and its wildlife. Or, the angled [[Summons Mountain Range]] mangled by the [[World Gyre]], spanning across [[Wyldere]].

**Bin**: [[Scape]]  
**Basin**: [[Sacrus]]  
**Eco**: **Toma** of [[Toman Ecoss]]

**Toma** is a flood plane within the Toman Ecoss in the [[Sacrus]] Basin. This plane is uniquely linked to a creature's subconscious (Michael) in the [[Earthen Ecoss]] of [[Swehel]] and to [[Corvi]], who originated in the Godan Ecoss of the [[Fractal Waters]]. Toma was created by the [[Goda]], a kingdom within the Fractal Waters, and serves as the central hub for the surrounding planes.

# Toman Planes

The Toman Planes comprise all planes accompanying Toma's [[Scape#Openscape| Openscape]]:

- [[Scape (TTRPG)/1 Purpose Taxonomy/Complete Taxonomy/02 Eco/01 Toman Ecoss/02 Toma/Toma]]
- [[Soul Fields]]
- [[Imaan Plane|Imaan Planes]]

### Fated Plane

The fate of Toma, as dictated by the unique nature of its creation and existence within [[Sacrus]], is a complex interplay of the forces established by the [[nth Creator]] and the [[1st Creator]]. These entities, representing laterality and linearity, have shaped the principles of fate within the [[Scape]], creating a multidimensional environment where perception and reality are intricately woven.
