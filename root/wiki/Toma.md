**Eco:** **Toma**

## Summary

Toma is the plane where the game will be starting. I am excited for everything to be slowly uncovered. 

## Geography and Biodiversity

Toma's physical geography is extreme, consisting of towering angled mountains (see [[World Gyre]]), expansive druidic forests, the great [[Swirling Sea]], as well as complex biodiversity to compete for its resources.
