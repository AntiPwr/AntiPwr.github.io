# Line

A **Line** is a period of time in the Toman Ecoss cosmology, defined as the span between two consecutive [[Gyre Shift|gyre shifts]]. Each Line represents a unique age or era, marked by a distinct configuration of spiritual, material, and metaphysical forces. The transition from one Line to the next is triggered by a gyre shiftâ€”a cosmic event in which the [[World Gyre]] changes its rotation, resulting in profound transformations across the plane.

## Definition

A Line begins immediately after a Gyre Shift and ends with the next Gyre Shift. The duration of a Line can vary, but it typically lasts several centuries, depending on cosmic and metaphysical factors. <!-- such as the accumulation of souls by [[Never]] and the balance of power among kingdoms and forces.-->

## Significance

- Each Line is characterized by its own unique challenges, advancements, and cultural developments.
- The end of a Line often brings upheaval, renewal, or dramatic change, setting the stage for the next era.
- The concept of Lines helps historians, scholars, and mystics organize the history of Toma into meaningful epochs.
