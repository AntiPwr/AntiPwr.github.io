# Resonant
_Hybrid Kingdom, Bridging Kingdom, Linking Kingdom_

> _"The whole is more than the sum of its parts."_  
> **â€”Aristotle**

A **Resonant** is a unique type of creature within the [[Toman Ecoss]] that exists across two or more kingdoms, embodying the traits and functions of these kingdoms simultaneously. Resonants are often seen as hybrid entities, combining the abilities, characteristics, and purposes of multiple kingdoms into a single being. This interconnection grants them unique powers and roles within the Toman Ecoss, making them pivotal in maintaining the balance between different ecological and spiritual realms.

## Characteristics and Role

Resonants are born from the merging or overlap of kingdoms, leading to their existence in multiple realms of life. They often possess abilities that are amplified or enhanced due to their resonance between these kingdoms, allowing them to serve as bridges or conduits between different aspects of existence. Their roles within the Toman Ecoss are varied and can include everything from guardians of sacred thresholds to agents of change within their respective ecosystems.

## Influence and Legacy

Resonants play a critical role in the dynamics of the Toman Ecoss, as their unique nature allows them to influence the balance between kingdoms. Their existence often brings about significant changes within the planes they inhabit, whether through direct intervention or by merely existing as a point of convergence between different realms. The legacy of Resonants is one of interconnection, adaptation, and the blending of diverse elements to create new forms of life and purpose within the universe.

## Known Resonant Subkingdoms

Resonants can be further categorized into subkingdoms, which are specific groups or types of Resonants that share common traits or origins. These subkingdoms represent the diversity and complexity of resonance within the Toman Ecoss:

- **[[Nadie]]**: Automata + Natura
- **[[Varmid]]**: Ferra + Monstra
- **[[Kill-Switch]]**: Automata + Monstra
- **[[Zothros]]**: Ferra + Huma
- **[[Anthros]]**: Huma + Ferra
- **[[Fearmonger]]**: Psychological/fear-based
- **[[Gaial]]**: Ferra + Bluma
- **[[Primordial]]**: Ferra-2-3
- **[[Chiment]]**: Ferra + Natura
- **[[Iptul]]**: Bluma + Natura
- **[[Dyirthik]]** Bluma + Monstra

## Polyresonance

**Polyresonance** is a rare phenomenon in which a creature develops significant traits from three or more kingdoms, resulting in beings of immense power and complexity. Polyresonant entities are not just hybrids, but true convergences of multiple kingdoms, often serving as pivotal figures in myth, history, and the balance of the Toman Ecoss.

### Notable Polyresonant Creatures

- **[[Alwa]]**: A legendary primordial, said to embody Celia, Bluma, Natura, Huma, and Spira.
- **Primordials**: Ancient beings, each polyresonant in their own right (see [[Primordial]] for details).
    - [[Vaosi]]
    - **[[Spawn of Hidraal|Ahdom Drakes]]**: [[Qa'ura]], [[Kautiger]], [[Lopali]]

Other polyresonant creatures may exist, but these are the most prominent and well-documented in Toman lore.

Polyresonance is considered the ultimate expression of resonance, where the boundaries between kingdoms blur and new forms of life and power emerge.

### Subresonants

Resonants can be further categorized into Subresonants, which are specific groups or types of Resonants that share common traits or origins. These Subresonants represent the diversity and complexity of resonance within the Toman Ecoss:

- **[[Nadie]]**: A Resonant kingdom formed from the union of Automata and Natura, emphasizing the balance between technology and nature.
- **[[Varmid]]**: A Resonant group that merges the characteristics of Ferra and Monstra life, often playing roles as scavengers or survivors within harsh environments.
- **[[Kill-Switch]]**: A dangerous Resonant type associated with sudden and catastrophic changes, often acting as agents of destruction or transformation within their ecosystems.
- **[[Zothros]]**: A Subresonant representing the convergence of the primal instincts of predators and the intellectual capabilities of humanoids.
- **[[Anthros]]**: A counterpart to Zothros, focusing on the harmony between humanity and the natural world, often embodying ideals of coexistence and stewardship.
- **[[Fearmonger]]**: A Resonant type that thrives on fear and psychological influence, often serving as agents of chaos or manipulation.
- **[[Gaial]]**: Resonants connected to the earth and natural cycles, embodying the regenerative and destructive powers of the planet.
- **[[Primordial]]**: Ancient Resonants that represent the original forces of creation and destruction, often holding immense power and influence over the evolution of life within the Toman Ecoss.
- [[Chiment]]: Ferra + Natura
- [[Iptul]]: Bluma + Natura
- [[Dyirthik]]
