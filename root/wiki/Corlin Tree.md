# Corlin Tree
_Henning Tree ([[Sol Unita|Sol Unitan]] Culture_)

The **Corlin Tree** is a remarkable and unique species of the [[Bluma]] subkingdom, native to the continent of [[Concordia]]. Known for its curvy, tall, and branching structure, the Corlin Tree serves not only as a botanical marvel but also as an essential component of Concordian infrastructure, particularly in buildings such as the [[Library of Ledh]].

## Nature and Function

The Corlin Tree possesses a mystical ability to transport creatures by reforming their bodies and pulling them into its branches. This transportation is facilitated by the tree's dual-root system. When a creature touches one of the tree's roots, they are instantaneously transferred across to the other rooting side. This natural transport system is highly valued in Concordian architecture, allowing for seamless movement between different levels of a structure.

## Physical Characteristics

The Corlin Tree has contorted, dark, waxy wood that twists in a single direction, protecting the inner wood that enables the transportation of souls through the tree. Its leaves are crystalline and white, dissolving in rain or water. These delicate leaves are not only visually striking but also hold culinary value. They are used in various recipes, providing an earthy and wet crunch, similar to cabbage or water chestnut but much thinner. The leaves are also the key ingredient in [[Blank Tea]], a delicate and prized beverage in Concordian culture.

## Historical Significance

During the [[Cel Blindbirth Line]], the Corlin Tree was thought to have gone extinct due to the overwhelming presence of [[Celia]] and [[Primordial]] forces. However, at the start of the [[Line from Few]], before the formation of the [[Branches of Concordia]], the Corlin Tree surprisingly reemerged and populated Concordia, making up roughly 28 percent of all trees. This resurgence of the Corlin Tree was recognized from ancient [[Esterik]] slates and reconnected to Concordian Huma culture, becoming a significant symbol of their heritage and identity.

## Decline and Conservation

Early Seos policies, which prioritized rapid resource extraction and expansion, allowed for the logging of Corlin Trees. These policies led to the tree population plummeting to an estimated 1% of its original number, nearly causing the species' second extinction. The destruction of Corlin Trees was recognized as a severe cultural and ecological loss, leading to a dramatic shift in governance.

Under Leiflan policies, the harvesting of Corlin Trees is now considered an act of treason, punishable by death. The execution method for this crime involves tying the offender to a heavy rock and releasing them into the [[Sea of Absence]]. Due to the extreme depth of the sea, the pressure crushes the individual before they have a chance to drown, serving as a grim deterrent against the destruction of this revered species.

## Reproduction and Growth

Corlin Trees are rare and difficult to cultivate, producing only two seeds every fifty years. These seeds are incredibly selective, searching for each other to ensure successful growth. If the seeds find suitable conditions, they will root and grow into a single, unified tree. The process of nurturing these seeds is a delicate art, requiring careful attention to light and environmental conditions to encourage the two roots to meet and form one tree. Interestingly, the Corlin Tree is believed to possess two souls, one for each seed, which merge as the tree grows.

## Cultural and Economic Significance

Due to their rarity and the difficulty in cultivating them, Corlin Tree seeds are extremely expensive and highly prized. The Concordians have developed sophisticated methods for nurturing these trees, which are seen as symbols of unity and connection. The dual-root system of the Corlin Tree is a metaphor for the Concordian belief in interconnectedness and the importance of harmonious relationships, both in nature and society.

In addition to their practical use in architecture, Corlin Trees hold a special place in Concordian culture, representing the fusion of life and the seamless blending of different elements into a unified whole. Their presence in key structures like the [[Library of Ledh]] underscores their importance to the cultural and spiritual fabric of Concordia. The Corlin Tree's history, from near-extinction to protection, mirrors the resilience and adaptability of Concordian society itself.
