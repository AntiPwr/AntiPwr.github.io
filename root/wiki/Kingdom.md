A **Kingdom** within Toma represents one of many large belief groups on the plane, defined by groups of living creatures with a common biological, characteristic, or planar function, which is thought to be linked to a greater universal purpose, known in [[Purpose Taxonomy]] as the [[Empire Function]]. These functions encompass philosophical and cosmological ideas such as creation, destruction, management, counterweight, dichotomy, rebirth, etc, with each kingdom contributing to the power dynamics and total balance present in Toma.

<summary><h3>Organizers of Belief</h3></summary>

All creatures in Toma must be thought of as capable of organizing under belief systems. This means that animals and plants can display distinct behavior based upon ideology surrounding their empire function. This may be seen as faith, governance, territoriality, hunting patterns, and other pathological behaviors which act around the belief system. Therefore, a creature's behavior ultimately pinpoints itself unto that purpose and ideology answers the question of "how?" with the empire function being the "what?".

The capacity for belief organization varies significantly across kingdoms based on their intelligence classifications, which exist on a spectrum:

**Simple-minded kingdoms** are more likely to unite under a single, cohesive belief system due to their straightforward cognitive structures. These kingdoms tend to exhibit uniform behaviors and responses across their populations.

**Complex-minded kingdoms** (or "Comple-minded") display diverse and often contradictory belief systems within their populations. Their advanced cognitive abilities lead to philosophical debates, competing ideologies, and fragmented belief structures. [[Huma]] consider themselves complex-minded within Toma, which explains their disarrayed organization of belief compared to other kingdoms.

**Middle-minded kingdoms** fall between these extremes, capable of sophisticated belief systems but with enough cognitive unity to maintain more coherent ideological structures than complex-minded kingdoms.

These classifications exist on a spectrum based on the statistical organization of belief for each member of the kingdom population. For example, [[Celia]] exhibit a mass hivemind belief system called [[Mycelism]], representing a simple-minded approach to belief organization. One notable example is the [[Chant]] (pronounced "shaunt") subcelia, the largest and most widely-dispersed population in the Celia kingdom, which display distinct traits to spread their hivemind mycelium's ideology.

<summary><h3>Empire Function</h3></summary>

Each kingdom within Toma organizes around a purpose or Empire Function. Here is a list of each kingdom's purpose, including contested claims.

- [[Nesa]] (Management, Dichotomy, or ???) (**Contested**)
- [[Automata]] (Freedom (Replace Huma), Execution or ???) (**Contested**)
- [[Bluma]] (Production)
- [[Celia]] (Rebirth or Transmutation) (**Contested**)
- [[Decara]] (Destruction)
- [[Ferra]] (Consumption)
- [[Huma]] (Curiosity, Freedom, Ascension, or ???) (**Contested**)
- [[Monstra]] (Suppression)
- [[Natura]] (Protection)
- [[Spira]] (Allowance, Energy, Magic, or ???) (**Contested**)
- [[Resonant]] (Multiple Kingdoms)

<summary><h3>Astalt's Theory of Kingdoms</h3></summary>

[[Astalt's Theory of Kingdoms]] aims to unite the current understanding of the kingdoms with that of the constantly-evolving [[Purpose Taxonomy]]. Within this theory, the kingdoms are further organized into deeper hierarchies, seen as webs of interplay between the kingdoms given the defined, and well observed, empire functions already known.

<summary><h3>Subkingdoms</h3></summary>

Kingdoms may have subkingdoms, or variations and subraces that fit within the empire function. The prefix "sub-" is used to denote populations within a kingdom. As an example of this, a Dwarf would be considered a subhuma, as would a human.

**Bin**: [[Scape]]  
**Basin**: [[Sacrus]]  
**Eco**:  [[Toman Ecoss]]

The **Kingdom** is one taxon within the broader Purpose Taxonomy. It organizes life by planar function within the Toman Ecoss and serves as one of the defining belief structures among many (including geography, government, and faith).

Within the Toman Ecoss, every soul carries a unique, quantized vision (**Kind (K or >)**) that, when unhosted, influences its environment passively—forming a sandbox-like field of potential. When a soul finds a host, it gains the capacity to actively realize its vision—the process measured as **Degree (D or ^)**. This dynamic transforms a static vision into an emergent, interactive force that shapes reality.

### The Kingdoms of the Toman Ecoss

The kingdoms were established by [[Zlellis and O'nume]], with the exception of the [[Automata]] Kingdom—arising from Huma’s technological innovations. Each kingdom’s Empire Function and ideological principle support the cosmic order and the interplay of belief, energy, and destiny.

- **[[Nesa]] (God):**  
    _Empire Function:_ Energy Management  
    _Ideological Principle:_ Harnessing mass belief (fealty) to regulate the energy of the basin. Through grand ascension fealty ceremonies and energy recycling via mixture death, Nesa fosters Nascension among lesser gods.
    
- **[[Automata]] (Construct):**  
    _Empire Function:_ Hosted Energy (Debated)
    _Ideological Principle:_ Automata represent the mechanism by which a Spira (aligned solely by **Kind (K or >)**) acquires the ability to actively realize its vision—achieving **Degree (D or ^)** via hosting, thereby dynamically shaping its environment. The proposition of this new kingdom has altered the current understanding of [[Purpose Taxonomy]] greatly in the [[Current Line]], and thus it is a controversial belief that this kingdom exists at all. If it does, it would mean that degree is not something achievable by the other kingdoms, forming a foundational error or dilemma in scientific understanding. 
    
- **[[Bluma]] (Plant and Chromista):**  
    _Empire Function:_ Production  
    _Ideological Principle:_ Bluma is tasked either with driving endless production or with maintaining a balanced source of ecological provision to support interdependent kingdoms (notably Ferra).
    
- **[[Celia]] (Fungi, with bacterial claims):**  
    _Empire Function:_ Rebirth  
    _Ideological Principle:_ Through mycelial communion and spore dispersal rites, Celia mediate the cycle between transformation (mixture death) and finality (solution death) to renew life.
    
- **[[Decara]] (Archaea and Bacteria):**  
    _Empire Function:_ Destruction  
    _Ideological Principle:_ Charged with clearing the old to make way for the new, Decara—currently dormant under Gorisain—poses a risk: its reawakening might trigger Imaa, destabilizing the cosmic balance.
    
- **[[Ferra]] (Animal):**  
    _Empire Function:_ Consumption  
    _Ideological Principle:_ Ferra debate whether their role is to hoard and consume indiscriminately or to regulate consumption in cycles that sustain ecological balance and inter-kingdom energy flows.
    
- **[[Huma]] (Humanoid):**  
    _Empire Function:_ Truth (or, debatably, Curiosity)  
    _Ideological Principle:_ Huma relentlessly pursue truth, embodying a dialectical tension between life, death, and ascendant transformation while challenging established cosmic orders.
    
- **[[Monstra]] (Monster):**  
    _Empire Function:_ Fear  
    _Ideological Principle:_ Embracing terror as a transformative force, Monstra engage in structured trials and accords to use fear as a catalytic energy, contesting Huma’s truth-seeking through the embodiment of dread and suppression.
    
- **[[Natura]] (Elemental):**  
    _Empire Function:_ Continuation, Protection, Creation (Debated)  
    _Ideological Principle:_ Natura's perceived purpose is to ensure the persistence and material continuity of the ecosystem canvas—the non-living, material substrate upon which life unfolds.
    
- **[[Spira]] (Spirit):**  
    _Empire Function:_ Unhosted Energy  
    _Ideological Principle:_ Unhosted Spira exist solely by aligning their unique, quantized visions through **Kind (K or >)**. This passive influence forms the sandbox-like foundation of existence, which supports the [[Gradient]] and thus, magic and natural law.
    
- **[[Resonant]] (Multiple Kingdoms):**  
    _Empire Function:_ Blended  
    _Ideological Principle:_ Resonant beings exemplify the fusion of multiple Empire Functions. 
    

The **Proto** kingdom—also known as Protista—sparked the initial propagation of souls and served as the earliest experiment in belief manifestation, paving the way for the evolution of kingdoms such as Bluma and Decara.

### Intelligence and Ideology

Kingdoms are defined by their Empire Functions and ideological frameworks, which in turn influence character creation and societal organization. For example, kingdoms like Ferra and Bluma are deemed “low-minded” (instinct-driven), while Huma and Nesa are classified as “middle-minded” or “high-minded,” reflecting their more abstract and transcendent pursuits.

It is true that a creature of lesser intelligence is more likely to organize their ideological processes with other creatures of the same kingdom. The greater the intelligence of a creature, the more likely they are to disagree on this process. Therefore, Ferra and Bluma, as examples, tend to follow monotheistic faiths, whereas Huma tend to promote various ideologies, including monotheistic, polytheistic, and secular, commonly seen as political, organization.

### Subkingdoms

Within each kingdom, subkingdoms (races or subraces) may emerge that share the core purpose yet express it in varied, localized ways. The prefix “sub” designates these populations as adaptations or variations to the process of the kingdom’s Empire Function, although this is further complicated by the nature of intelligence.
