**Eco:** [[Toma]] <br>
**Kingdom**

**Kingdoms** within Toma represent the largest belief groups on the plane, defined by groups of living creatures with a common biological, characteristic, or planar function, which is thought to be linked to a greater universal purpose, known in Purpose Taxonomy as the **Empire Function**. These functions encompass ideas such as creation, destruction, management, counterweight, dichotomy, rebirth, etc, with each kingdom contributing to the power dynamics and total balance present in Toma.

<summary><h3>Organizers of Belief</h3></summary>

All creatures in Toma must be thought of as capable of organizing under belief systems. This means that animals and plants can display distinct behavior based upon ideology surrounding their empire function. This may be seen as faith, governance, territoriality, hunting patterns, etc. which act around the belief system. Therefore, a creature's behavior ultimately pinpoints itself unto that purpose and ideology answers the question of "how?" with the empire function being the "what?".

One example of this is the Chant (pronounced "shaunt") subcelia, the largest and most widely-dispersed population in the Celia kingdom, which display distinct traits to spread their hivemind mycelium's ideology.

<summary><h3>Astalt's Theory of Kingdoms</h3></summary>

[[Astalt's Theory of Kingdoms]] aims to unite the current understanding of the kingdoms with that of the constantly-evolving [[Purpose Taxonomy]]. Within this theory, the kingdoms are further organized into deeper hierarchies, seen as webs of interplay between the kingdoms given the defined, and well observed, empire functions already known.

<summary><h3>Subkingdoms</h3></summary>

Kingdoms may have subkingdoms, or variations and subraces that fit within the empire function. The prefix "sub-" is used to denote populations within a kingdom. As an example of this, a Dwarf would be considered a subhuma, as would a human.
