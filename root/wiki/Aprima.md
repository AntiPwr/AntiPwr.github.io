## Presence in Scender

Aprima is found in constructions throughout [[Scender]], though it is most concentrated within **Scender Proper**. The material is used in the construction of the city’s most sacred and significant structures, often in combination with [[Sar Glass]], another highly valued resource. Buildings composed of aprima and sar glass have a luminous, ethereal quality, reflecting the city’s emphasis on spiritual enlightenment and technological harmony.

Some of the most prominent aprima-based structures include:

- The **[[Solscept]]**, the central research institution of Scender
- The **[[Asath Sanctuary]]**, where aprima forms the **Grand Stair** and **Chamber of Light**
- Various temples, shrines, and public altars throughout **Scender Proper**

Despite its presence in the city, aprima is strictly regulated, with only **designated religious and governmental authorities** permitted to work with or distribute it.


## Aprima Beads (Ascension Beads)

Among the most coveted forms of aprima are the small, pure white **Ascension Beads**. These beads hold immense religious significance for followers of [[Asceptim]], especially under the doctrine propagated by Ophelia Necesse during her reign over Sancta and her guidance of Sol Unita’s religious and educational institutions. According to Asceptim’s teachings, possession of an ascension bead is a sacred requirement for collective ascension—a belief that, upon death or at the time of the prophesied ascension, only those who carry a bead will join their fellow faithful in [[Sol Proscima]].

While not all sects or individuals believe in collective ascension, Asceptim’s influence has made the pursuit of an ascension bead a near-universal aspiration among the devout. Countless followers strive to obtain one, often regarding it as the most cherished of all religious trinkets. The beads’ importance is reinforced through scripture and oral storytelling, and they are worn with pride alongside other sacred garb. To be without an ascension bead is, in the eyes of many, to risk spiritual isolation from the community in the afterlife.

These beads are typically bestowed during rites, major religious ceremonies, or as recognition of service to the faith. Their luminous purity and the difficulty of acquiring genuine aprima make them both a symbol of personal devotion and a tangible link to the promise of ascension.

The purity of an individual's aprima bead is often viewed—sometimes unconsciously—as a sign of religious or spiritual prominence within Asceptim society. While this was never intended as a formal system of social hierarchy, over time it became embedded in the culture, with the most flawless beads quietly associated with higher status or deeper devotion. This subtle distinction frequently sparks gossip and conversation among the faithful, fueling both admiration and envy in equal measure.

## Properties and Uses

Aprima is highly durable and resistant to wear, making it an ideal material for sacred architecture. It has the unique ability to **absorb and refract light**, allowing buildings made from aprima to radiate an almost otherworldly glow, particularly during sunrise and sunset.

Due to its purity, aprima is reserved for structures and artifacts with deep spiritual importance. It is commonly used in:

- **Ceremonial artifacts**, such as religious tablets and high priest adornments
- **Sacred architecture**, including temple foundations, altars, and monolithic pillars
- **Spiritual pathways**, where aprima stones are arranged to guide believers toward sites of worship

![[Aprima.png]]

Aprima is the purest form of [[Primma]], a rare and highly revered [[Hollow Resource]] derived from the ascension of the [[Primordial]] being [[Alwa]]. It is distinguished by its brilliant white color, symbolizing complete spiritual ascension and enlightenment. In [[Sol Unita]], aprima is regarded as the most sacred building material, used almost exclusively for religious and governmental structures, reinforcing its significance as a representation of divine connection.

## Formation and Origins

Aprima is formed through the process of spiritual transcendence, specifically during the full ascension of a being beyond Toma’s material realm. This event, known as recomposition into the higher plane, results in the creature’s body being refined into a hollow resource, with aprima emerging from the most spiritually attuned essence.

Unlike standard primma, which can appear in various colors based on the nature of its source, aprima is always a stark white, untouched by impurities. It is considered the rarest and most potent form of primma, as true ascension is an exceedingly rare occurrence.

## Presence in Scender

Aprima is found throughout [[Scender]], though it is most concentrated within **Scender Proper**. The material is used in the construction of the city’s most sacred and significant structures, often in combination with [[Sar Glass]], another highly valued resource. Buildings composed of aprima and sar glass have a luminous, ethereal quality, reflecting the city’s emphasis on spiritual enlightenment and technological harmony.

Some of the most prominent aprima-based structures include:

- The **[[Solscept]]**, the central seat of governance and faith
- The **[[Asath Sanctuary]]**, where aprima forms the **Grand Stair** and **Chamber of Light**
- The **[[Ester Slates]]**, particularly the **[[Rite of Passage]]**, which is believed to be inscribed on aprima
- Various temples, shrines, and public altars throughout **Scender Proper**

Despite its presence in the city, aprima is strictly regulated, with only **designated religious and governmental authorities** permitted to work with or distribute it.

- **Spiritual pathways**, where aprima stones are arranged to guide believers toward sites of worship

## Symbolism in Sol Unita

Aprima represents the highest aspiration of faith within **Asceptim**, embodying the pursuit of **[[Sol Proscima]]**. As a material that cannot be artificially created, it serves as a constant reminder that true ascension must be earned, not fabricated.

Its use in **religious and governmental buildings** reinforces the ideology that faith and governance are inseparable in **Sol Unita**, ensuring that the city’s physical structures reflect its guiding spiritual principles.
