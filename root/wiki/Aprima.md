Aprima is the purest form of [[Primma]], a rare and highly revered [[Hollow Resource]] believed to be derived from the remains of the [[Primordial]], [[Alwa]]. It is distinguished by its brilliant white color. In [[Sol Unita]], aprima is regarded as the most sacred building material, used almost exclusively for religious and governmental structures, reinforcing its significance as a representation of divine connection.

## Presence in Scender

Aprima is found in constructions throughout [[Scender]], though it is most concentrated within **Scender Proper**. The material is used in the construction of the city’s most sacred and significant structures, often in combination with [[Sar Glass]], another highly valued resource. Buildings composed of aprima and sar glass have a luminous, ethereal quality, reflecting the city’s emphasis on spiritual enlightenment and technological harmony.

Some of the most prominent aprima-based structures include:

- The **[[Solscept]]**, the central research institution of Scender
- The **[[Asath Sanctuary]]**, where aprima forms the **Grand Stair** and **Chamber of Light**
- Various temples, shrines, and public altars throughout **Scender Proper**

Despite its presence in the city, aprima is strictly regulated, with only **designated religious and governmental authorities** permitted to work with or distribute it.

## Properties and Uses

Aprima is highly durable and resistant to wear, making it an ideal material for sacred architecture. It has the unique ability to **absorb and refract light**, allowing buildings made from aprima to radiate an almost otherworldly glow, particularly during sunrise and sunset.

Due to its purity, aprima is reserved for structures and artifacts with deep spiritual importance. It is commonly used in:

- **Ceremonial artifacts**, such as religious tablets and high priest adornments
- **Sacred architecture**, including temple foundations, altars, and monolithic pillars
- **Spiritual pathways**, where aprima stones are arranged to guide believers toward sites of worship
