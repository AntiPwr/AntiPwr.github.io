High Dwellers are the native people of the skyward city-state of [[Hypri]], renowned for their elevated settlements, mastery of vertical living, and philosophical pursuit of clarity, wisdom, and perspective. They inhabit the highest reaches of the spire Vespir, both physically and culturally seeking vantage points above the chaos of the world below.

## Culture and Society

High Dwellers value enlightenment, observation, and the cultivation of knowledge. Their society is structured around mentorship, contemplation, and the sharing of insights. They are often mediators, advisors, or scholars, guiding others with their broad perspective.

- **Architecture:** Homes and communal spaces are built at great heights, symbolizing their ideals and connection to the sky.
- **Traditions:** Rituals often involve ascension, meditation, and the pursuit of higher understanding.
- **Relations:** High Dwellers are respected for their wisdom, though sometimes seen as aloof or detached by other peoples of the Scape.

## Role in Hypri

High Dwellers serve as visionaries and keepers of lore, helping to maintain balance and foresight within Hypri. Their unique perspective allows them to anticipate changes and guide the flow of [[Crea]] and purpose throughout the city. They are closely associated with the governance of Hypri, often holding positions of influence within the [[Hypri Highcourt]] and acting as stewards of tradition.

## Connection to the Spire

The identity of High Dwellers is inseparable from the spire of Vespir. They maintain the oldest belief systems centered around the veneration of the spires and the deity [[Sibannac]]. Their relationship with the land below is marked by caution and a strong sense of cultural preservation, reinforced by stories and rituals that emphasize the dangers of the Usakan Growth and the importance of remaining true to their skyward heritage.
