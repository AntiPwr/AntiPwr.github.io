Advancism is a belief system thought to be naturally derived from the resonance of [[Huma]] and [[Ferra]], focused on the progression of intelligence, directly opposing [[Primalism]]. This belief is typically held by [[Anthros]] species,Â influenced heavily by the direction that resonance brought them in, in terms of the progression of intelligence.
