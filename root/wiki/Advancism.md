# Advancism

<img src="Advancism.png"><i></i></img>

Advancism is a belief system naturally derived from the resonance of [[Huma]] and [[Ferra]] and directly opposes [[Primalism]]. This belief is typically held by [[Anthros]] species, influenced heavily by the intellectual direction that resonance brought them in terms of evolutionary change.

## Resonance and Evolution

Advancism emerges from the resonance between Huma (human) and Ferra (animal) kingdoms. This resonance is not just a blending of traits, but a dynamic evolutionary process that changes behavioral, psychological, and even pathological characteristics of creatures. Advancists seek the advancement of technology and society through the use of tools, innovation, and collective progress. The ideology is shaped by the direction and degree of resonance and evolution with other kingdoms. For example, a Ferra that evolves to have more Huma traits (becoming an [[Anthros]]) tends toward advancist ideology, embracing intellect, tool use, and societal complexity. Conversely, a Huma that evolves to have more Ferra traits (becoming a [[Zothros]]) is more likely to lean toward primalist ideologies. Evolution here is not only physical, but also conscious, subconscious, and mentalâ€”creatures with higher reliance on resonance are more likely to experience rapid and diverse changes in their worldview and capabilities.

## Ideological Traits

Advancists are characterized by a drive for technological and societal advancement, with an emphasis on innovation, learning, and the use of tools. They are open to change and adaptation, often at the expense of traditional or natural ways, and tend to form complex social structures and hierarchies. While Advancism is often seen as progressive, it is not entirely disconnected from nature. Advancists may still value their origins, but prioritize growth, mastery, and the transformation of the environment to suit their needs.

## Interconnections and Subphylums

Advancism is not a monolithic ideology. It has many subphylums and overlaps with other belief systems. For example, Advancism shares much in common with [[Asceptim]], leading to population mingling and cooperation in societies like [[Sol Unita]] (notably in [[Scender]] and [[Sipua]]), where Huma and Ferra coexist and collaborate. Advancist societies are often hubs of cultural exchange, invention, and philosophical debate, drawing from both their animalistic roots and their drive for progress.
