# Manrotter

<img src="wiki_images/Manrotter.png"><i></i></img>

A **Manrotter** is a type of [[Celia#Subcelia|subcelia]] mushroom found in aquatic environments across Toma. Manrotters are known for their predatory, corpse-consuming behavior: they bend their wide, flexible caps to envelop and digest animal remains—either forming a dome underwater or a capsule above water. Beyond their role in decomposition and nutrient cycling, manrotters are infamous for their seductive influence on [[Huma]] and other sentient beings. Through bioluminescent displays, heated waters, and (according to folklore) even hallucinatory or psychic lures, manrotters can entice weakened or despairing individuals to willingly offer themselves to the mushroom's collective, furthering the growth of their hivemind.

## Description

Manrotters are aquatic mushrooms with long, flowy stems and wide, flexible caps. The cap can bend at the edges, forming domes underwater or capsule-like shapes above water. Manrotters are typically found at the shallow edges of creeks, rivers, and ponds, where they anchor to the soil and thrive in nutrient-rich environments.

## Life Cycle and Feeding

Manrotters benefit from the hunting and migration patterns of [[Ferra]] and other animals seeking water. They spread their spores downstream and feed on decaying organic matter, especially animal carcasses. When a carcass is present, the manrotter bends its cap to envelop and consume it, sharing nutrients with nearby mushrooms through connected stems.

## Hivemind and Communication

Manrotter hiveminds function through waterways and mycelial networks. Colonies often begin at the sources of rivers, lakes, and ponds, transferring spores and silent mycelial communication downstream. This allows manrotters to share nutrients, coordinate growth, and respond collectively to environmental changes, making their presence felt throughout entire aquatic systems. While all manrotters use waterways to communicate, certain varieties—such as the Blue Manrotter—are especially adapted to streams, brooks, and creeks, where their mycelial networks are most intricate and their collective intelligence most pronounced. These behaviors are central to many local rituals and stories throughout Toma.

## Rituals and Folklore

In regions like the [[Clutched Forest]], it is common to offer small animals to manrotters as part of local rituals. The mushrooms respond by releasing bioluminescent spores, which heat the water and create glowing blue streams. Folklore tells of manrotters assuming [[Huma]] forms to lure weakened or dying creatures into the water, a motif especially associated with the Blue Manrotter.
