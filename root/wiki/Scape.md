Bin 0

The Scape is the fabric of reality that encompasses all dimensions and planes within [[Bin|Bin 0]]. It is the boundary on which the destinies of realms like Toma are painted. Within the Scape, there are three primary dimensions, each with its own unique characteristics and significance. The Scape is infinitely expanding vertically, through the creation of dimensions, and horizontally, through the creations of planes in those dimensions.

# Mandelbrot Set

Bin 0 fills its basins, or dimensions, in the lateral shape of the [Mandelbrot Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) to ensure stability of the universe and the propagation of life within it, organized in the desired way of the *n*th creator in order to best reach infinity.

If you go outside the Mandelbrot Set, the creator cannot control the progress and the Universe will be unbalanced and thus die.



Lateral Universe is filled similarly to Mandelbrot sets

# Hollow Purpose

Holoscape or the Hollow Purpose refers to a [[Paximaa]] within the Scape.

# Scape Sectioning

Since each dimension is built upon the last, all the way up to the [[Source|Base Dimension]], the Scape can be visualized as an intrusion or extrusion of spatial dimension from this point. Essentially, the base dimension only consists of time and the entities that exist in it, while all else is built upon those two things. Due to this, the 
 
 Regions can be thought of as pools, where shallower or deeper basins of the same [[Spatial Equivalence|Spatially Equivalent]]

### Infinite Source

Source is the origin of existence. Each waking moment, Source is pulled from throughout the dimension in order to create. 

Source is pulled from in balance, ensuring that water does flow too fast down one lane and cause a Pax Imaa.

The water aims to fill the volume of each container it touches (fill every basin), from which all variations of existence will have occurred.

### Route of Information

Water always find its lowest point. most efficient way to expand the universe.




### Basins and Waterways

Each dimension in the Scape is called a Basin due to its foundational qualities and relationship to the fluid motion of all existence. 

### Openscape

The Openscape represents the expanses of the Scape that are either accessible or observable by the beings within a plane. What is considered the Openscape is dependent upon the rules of the dimension and plane.

### Closescape

The Closescape are all the realms beyond the immediate perception of planar beings.

### The Sands of Time

The Sands of Time, the Sands, or the Base Dimension is the basin of time, where all existence first sprouted from. This realm 

### Scape Expansion

The Scape expands exponentially in each dimension using soul production as the foundational energy and liquid fabric of the universe. When a [[Imaa#Planar Imaa|Planar Imaa]] occurs, its souls and any other souls related, become one with the universe and increase its size.



### Quest to the Ends of Infinity

A small percentage of inhabitants of the Scape aim to climb to infinity through ascension, but even fewer aim to not only climb it once, but twice on the horizontal plane. This is the quest to beat infinity through a total [[Imaa]]
