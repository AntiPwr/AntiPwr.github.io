Basins (plural)

A basin is a dimension of existence.

- [[Source]] (Base Dimension)
- [[Sacrus]] (First Dimension)
- [[Fractal Waters]] (Second Dimension)
- [[Swehel]] (Third Dimension)

# Point of No Creation

The Point of No Creation, or the basin boundary is the limit of stability within a dimension. Anything created outside of this is highly unstable and is a signifier of a [[Hollow Purpose]]. Typically life does not survive long in this universal zone, however matter tends to remain for much longer before disappearing into the void.

It is possible to travel outside of the basin boundary but it is incredibly unsafe. This could be a future campaign within the Solution, or perfect Scape.

# Toman Basin

- [[Sacrus]]
