# Mythos of the Endless Hunt
_Mohrs-vena Poems_  

Emerging into [[Huma]] culture from the conscious and subconscious depths of [[Thros]] evolution, the interconnected poems of the **Mythos of the Endless Hunt** examine the duality and conflict between Apex and Praeda—a mythic cycle of power, pursuit, and unfulfilled yearning. They reveal the underlying currents of [[Ferra|Ferran]] ancestry, the shifts in ideology, and the tragic beauty of a chase that echoes through time.

# Work in Progress

This page is a work in progress.

## I. Apex

_From the cold heart of the predator comes a requiem—a celebration of unyielding hunger, the art of the hunt, and a twisted adoration for the chase that offers no redemption._

### A. Covetous Hunt

*Apex claiming from others what she does not have, hence the Requiem she causes, as she thinks herself soulless but always looks above (Power) rather than underneath (Praeda).*

>

### B. Fallen Feast

_— Apex’s verses serve as both an ode to survival and a testament to a passion that leaves no room for mercy._

---

## II. Liminant

_The language of the hunt speaks in two tongues—a mirror of idealism and reality. In this transitional section, Praeda’s yearning for affection is voiced first, only to be shattered by the cold logic of Apex’s nature._

### Ideal

_Here, the hopeful murmur of Praeda’s inner longing is given voice, as she envisions a moment when the predator might offer tenderness:_

Next time, Ill stay for twice as long

### Lifesteal

_Then, the harsh reality intrudes—Apex’s relentless nature prevails, and the dream of empathy is crushed beneath the weight of inevitability:_

> I sense you wouldn't know good if  
> _it stood, eye to eye_  
> with you, but no, don't  
> "_run._"  
> I didn't mean to offend,  
> to stun—  
> a plea for love is all you've become.

> In a flash, idealism meets its demise—  
> the prey’s hope is devoured,  
> a lifesteal that leaves nothing but the echo of loss.  
> There is no salvation in this chase,  
> only the cold certainty that the hunt consumes all.

Next time, Ill come back twice as strong.

_— The liminal space between ideal and inevitable, where the language of Dai'iko becomes the silent adjudicator of fate._

---

## III. Praeda

### A. Zealous Pursuit

> We ran our circle, time and many again.  
> Amongst the soulless clouds we swam,  
> through the ceaseless rains we flew,  
> tampered soil and roots,  
> once our land, the sands we knew.  
> When cities were about all that remained,  
> I fled unto that last  
> grass blade;  
> Let be in your mind,  
> as the *only* thing that stood wearily between us.

### B. Infinite Injury

> _We_ thought in silence, in synchrony,  
> “the chase was long, because the chase was good.”  
> Let be in your mind  
> that no thing can stand,  
> however fortified,  
> between Her and I.  
> As she is as good as the chase,  
> if not worth lives more!  
> It is Her I do adore!

## Analysis

### Narrative Chronology

The Mythos of the Endless Hunt opens with three narratives, meant to be read interchangeably, but understood from top to bottom, allowing a glimpse at the parallel, yet dichotomous, relationship of Apex and Praeda. From left to right, the poem is organized through the understanding of the power dynamic, or the leverage Apex has over Praeda. However, the Dai'iko section of this poem switches this, placing the Ideal section, which is devoted to Praeda's perspective, first rather than second. This creates a yin-yang effect when understood next to Apex's Dai'iko section, considered by academics to be a writer's idealistic influence in search of resolving the [[Liminant, Delimination, Relimination#Liminant|Liminant]]. This is because, throughout the story and modern understanding of Apex and Praeda influence on Ferra populations, there is absolutely no remorse ever shown from a predator down the food chain. Similarly, this extremism is flipped as prey engage in longing for tenderness from their hunters, of course to no avail. This section, instead of allowing Apex to come first, essentially works against this idea of their being a divide or line in the sand between Apex and Praeda, or predator and prey. Again, this is considered a philosophical design influence from the author, hinting at the idea that nothing is impossible, especially love, no matter how unrequited it may seem. Another possible conclusion would be the idea of idealism being a trait that drains over the course of a creature's life due to the nature of the world. 

### Character Dynamics

- **Apex** is portrayed as an embodiment of relentless power, devoid of empathy—a predator whose very nature is to consume, leaving no room for remorse or tender connection. His pursuit is methodical and unyielding, a necessary aspect of survival that has been mythologized into a form of cold, almost mechanical ([[Shikari]]) beauty.
- **Praeda**, on the other hand, is the eternal embodiment of vulnerability and hope. Despite the ceaseless agony of being pursued and devoured by fate, Praeda’s voice is imbued with a desperate zeal—a yearning for a tenderness that the hunter can never truly reciprocate. This longing, however, is also a source of self-justified injury, a reminder of a tragic idealism that cannot withstand the harsh truths of existence.

Together, these voices create a dialogue of contradictions—a myth where love is both desired and impossible, where the chase is at once life-affirming and devastating. The poems, through their structure and language, invite the reader to reflect on the nature of desire, the inevitability of loss, and the eternal conflict between what is and what might be.
