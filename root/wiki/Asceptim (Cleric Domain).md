# Asceptim (Cleric Domain)

You are worthy of Ascension. Clerics of the **Asceptim Domain** harness the power of believing in Asath—Sol Proscima—and the values imbued in the Rites of Huma. Whether that means venerating technological advancement, augmenting body and mind, blending nature with technology, or chasing mental acuity and enhanced willpower, the power resides in faith-attuned beliefs. The rampant growth the religion has achieved, alongside its societal accomplishments, were all given to the Eye and His glory.

## Domain Spells

You gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the **Asceptim Domain Spells** table. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

|Cleric Level|Spells|
|---|---|
|1st|_Detect Magic_, _Guiding Bolt_|
|2nd|_Enhance Ability_, _Continual Flame_|
|3rd|_Beacon of Hope_, _Daylight_|
|4th|_Arcane Eye_, _Death Ward_|
|5th|_Flame Strike_, _Legend Lore_|

## Insight of the First Reality

_1st-Level Asceptim Domain Feature_

Your training or ceremonial blinding grants you a deeper spiritual perception that pierces mundane senses. At 1st level, you gain blindsight out to a range of 10 feet whenever you are concentrating on a spell. This blindsight increases to 20 feet at 6th level, 30 feet at 8th level, and 60 feet at 17th level.

This represents your ability to perceive the “First Reality” and sense subtle currents of faith and magic that others cannot.

## Channel Divinity: Solar Bloom

_2nd-Level Asceptim Domain Feature_

You can use your Channel Divinity to call upon Asath’s radiant power, infusing the surroundings with life-giving sunlight. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and a 30-foot radius around you becomes suffused with warm, golden light for 1 minute. This light is considered bright light, and dim light extends 30 feet beyond that.

While this effect lasts, you gain the following benefits in the bright light:

**Life-Giving Radiance.** All nonmagical plants in the bright light immediately flourish, sprouting vibrant leaves and blooms. Any nonmagical water in the area is instantly purified and becomes safe to drink (as though affected by purify food and drink).
**Vital Resilience.** Friendly creatures in the bright light have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned or diseased. If a friendly creature is already poisoned or diseased when you activate this ability, it can immediately make a saving throw against the effect, ending it on a success (using the original DC).
**Harmonic Calm.** Beasts that can see the bright light become calmly curious rather than hostile. They count as indifferent toward creatures in the light for the duration, unless harmed or provoked. If a beast is already hostile, it may make a Charisma saving throw against your Spell Save DC; on a failure, it becomes indifferent until the effect ends.
These blessings last as long as you maintain your Channel Divinity (up to 1 minute, or until you’re incapacitated). Once the light fades, plants remain enriched, but beasts revert to their previous attitudes unless other influences change their disposition.

## Clarity of Ascension

_6th-Level Asceptim Domain Feature_

Your faith-fueled insight deepens, giving you an uncanny perception of magical and technological forces. You gain the following benefits:

- **Ascendant Awareness.** You have advantage on saving throws against illusions.
- **Gnostic Eye.** You can cast _see invisibility_ on yourself once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.


## Potent Spellcasting

_8th-Level Asceptim Domain Feature_

You have learned how to channel your willpower and connection to Asath into your spellcraft. You add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

## Eye of Ascension

_17th-Level Asceptim Domain Feature_

Having walked the path of ascension and fully opened yourself to Asath’s radiance, your perception transcends mortal limits. You gain the following benefits:

- **Transcendent Blindsight.** Your blindsight extends to 60 feet while casting a spell (instead of only while you’re concentrating on a spell), and it can pierce invisibility and mundane darkness automatically.
- **Revelation of Truth.** Within your blindsight range, you automatically succeed on ability checks to perceive through illusions (as if under the effect of _true seeing_, though only within your blindsight range).



### Playing an Asceptim Cleric

**Roleplay Notes:**

- **Ceremonial Blinding.** Your eyes are shrouded by a blindfold or permanently scarred from a sacred ritual, but you do not lament this loss. Rather, you celebrate it as a gift that brings you closer to Asath’s illuminating presence.
- **Technological Curiosity.** Many Asceptim adherents believe technology and knowledge are integral stepping stones to ascension. How you approach these innovations may be central to your character’s journey—do you embrace them wholeheartedly, or do you see them merely as tools in service of divine truths?
- **Rites of Huma.** The Cel Blindbirth Line spent was a long period of subterranean society in your civilization’s history and its calamities have driven home the importance of light (Asath), hope, and escape from what lies below. Your devotion shapes your worldview: returning to the surface was not just physical but a spiritual journey that your blindfold symbolizes and finds gratitude in. What further growth occurs from there was granted by Asath.

**Combat & Tactics:**

- **Blindsight** and your Channel Divinity can grant you and allies a keen edge in detecting enemies, seeing through illusions, and navigating darkness.
- **Potent Spellcasting** adds reliable damage to your cantrips, giving you a reasonable damage option when you aren’t using higher-level spells to heal or support.
- **Eye of Ascension** at 17th level cements your role as a peerless detector of lies and illusions, making you an invaluable ally in high-level campaigns where hidden threats and magical disguises are abound.

## Channel Divinity: Glimpse Beyond

_2nd-Level Asceptim Domain Feature_

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to grant yourself or a willing creature a momentary glimpse into the hidden truths that Asath reveals.

- **As an action**, you touch a willing creature. For the next 5 minutes, that creature’s blindsight (if it has any) increases by 10 feet.
- Additionally, within that range of blindsight, the target can see magical auras as though under the effect of the _detect magic_ spell.
