<!--
**Imaan Planes**, also known as peak planes, are realms created by [[Zlellis and O'numeume]] to explore extreme ideologies and prevent an [[Imaa]] in the [[Toman Ecoss]]. These planes serve as testing grounds for prevailing beliefs, allowing them to play out in a controlled environment to ensure the balance and harmony of the Toman Ecoss. Each Imaan Plane is shaped by the collective beliefs and actions of its inhabitants, often manifesting as highly thematic and ideologically focused realms.

_"We are all children to our parent’s beliefs, but, yet still, locality keeps our hands in reach, no matter how far born. Ten people in ten regions may think they found the answer, developing laws, practices, people in the sky and mind, but the medium of their solution remains all the same. A god is subjective... as are you."_

Imaan Planes, also known as Imperfect Planes, are realms created by [[Zlellis and O'nume]] to explore extreme ideologies and prevent an [[Imaa]] in the [[Toman Ecoss]]. These planes serve as testing grounds for prevailing beliefs, allowing them to play out in a controlled environment to ensure the balance and harmony of the Toman Ecoss.

# Purpose and Influence

The primary purpose of Imaan Planes is to capture extremism and explore its consequences, preventing an Imaa by identifying and addressing ideological imbalances. The influence of these planes varies, with some exerting significant impact on the Toman Ecoss. The following are ranked in terms of influence:

- [[Arkon]]
- [[Dar]]
- [[Gaia]] (Fallen)
- [[Cadence]]
- [[June Preserve]]
- [[Glimpse]]

# Creation

The creation of an Imaan Plane is a type of [[Source Surge Types#In-between Expansion|Surge]], relying on [[Goda#Cycle of Rebirth|Detritus]] to construct and sustain a realm separate from the Toman Ecoss. This process is made possible through [[Never|Never’s]] soul imprisonment, which allows souls to fuel creation within the plane. In addition to the Goda's involvement, Imaan Planes can also be generated by the shared [[Belief Pool]]s of living Toman creatures through their participation in the In-between.

The In-between is a medium used by creatures of the Toman Ecoss to interact with the Imaan Planes, allowing them to contact [[Spira]] and [[Nesa]] in the [[Soul Fields]], generate belief and utilize anima, and create new Imaan Planes through an [[Source Surge Types#In-between Expansion|In-between Expansion]].

# Appearance

Imaan Planes become visible to creatures as they approach the [[Belief Pool]] associated with the plane. As a creature nears an Imaan Plane, subtle environmental changes occur, eventually revealing the entire location. These planes often adhere to a strict theme of extremist aesthetics, representing a belief system at its peak or idea of perfection. Changes in the environment are manifestations of the beliefs of creatures, known as [[Merchant System#Source Surge System|Source Surges]].

# Role in the Toman Ecoss

Imaan Planes play a critical role in maintaining the balance and harmony of the Toman Ecoss by exploring the consequences of extreme ideologies. They serve as both a warning and a guide, demonstrating the potential outcomes of unchecked beliefs and providing insight into the nature of creation and destruction.
