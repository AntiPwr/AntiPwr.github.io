**Apex and Praeda** represent the core dichotomy within the [[Ferra]] kingdom, embodying the eternal struggle between predator and prey. These two deities are central figures in the sister phylums of [[Mohrsmünt]] and [[Amarvena]], understood best through the [[Mythos of the Endless Hunt]], a foundational narrative that explores the relentless and cyclical chase between these two contradictory forces.

## Apex
_Soulless Shikari_

"That which cannot be killed

Apex is the [[Demon Nesa]] and the predator god of the Ferra, revered as the embodiment of the ultimate predator. As the deity of the [[Mohrsmünt]] phylum, Apex represents the ferocity, cunning, and instinctual drive that define the predator's role in the natural world. Apex is relentless, devoid of empathy, and driven purely by the need to hunt and survive. The mythology surrounding Apex emphasizes the god's unyielding pursuit of prey, a chase that is both a necessity and an inherent part of existence.

Apex’s manifestation is said to be the head of a predator that is made of a mass of prey, such as a swarm of rabbits making up the demonic head of a wolf.

## Praeda
_Fleeting Foot_

Praeda is the prey god of the Ferra, symbolizing the essence of the hunted and the constant struggle for survival. As the deity of the **Amarvena** phylum, Praeda embodies the vulnerability, agility, and fear that characterize the prey's existence. Praeda's narrative is one of perpetual flight, always one step ahead of Apex, yet forever bound to the chase. The mythology portrays Praeda as a tragic figure, doomed to be hunted endlessly, yet essential to the balance of life within the Ferra kingdom.

## The Mythos of the Endless Hunt

The [[Mythos of the Endless Hunt]] is a deeply ingrained story within the Ferra kingdom, depicting the eternal chase between Apex and Praeda. This mythos explains the natural order of predator and prey, where each is bound to the other in a never-ending cycle of life, death, and rebirth. The chase between Apex and Praeda is symbolic of the broader struggle within the natural world, where survival is a constant and the balance between life and death is maintained through this relentless pursuit.

## Cultural and Religious Significance

Within the Ferra kingdom, Apex and Praeda are not just deities but are integral to the cultural and religious practices of their people. The dichotomy between predator and prey is reflected in the daily lives of the Ferra, influencing their beliefs, rituals, and social structures. The reverence for Apex and Praeda also extends to the [[Dai'iko]] concept, which encapsulates this predator-prey relationship in both language and symbolism.

The [[Dai and Iko Stones]], formed from the decayed remains of Ferran creatures, serve as a physical representation of the bond between predator and prey. These stones, which vibrate in communication when placed within the same medium, are a reminder of the eternal connection between Apex and Praeda and the perpetual cycle of the hunt.

## Legacy

The legacy of Apex and Praeda within the [[Toman Ecoss]] is one of balance and the eternal struggle for survival. Their story is a testament to the natural order and the cyclical nature of life and death. The influence of Apex and Praeda continues to shape the beliefs and actions of the Ferra, ensuring that the mythos of the endless hunt remains a central tenet of their existence.

## Symbolism

In the Mythos of the Endless Hunt, as well as in the world of Toma, Apex and Praeda reincarnate as creatures engaged in a chase, however it is said that all Ferra contain this nature of the chase embedded within them. Apex and Praeda can manifest in physical forms throughout the world, but not without the manifestation of the other, seen within a chase. If Apex assumes the form of a primordial, she may knock down cliffsides in search of the agile Praeda that tends to stay one step ahead.

## The Dryaught: The Third Ferra God

The Dryaught is a third god mutually worshipped by both Amarvena and Mohrsmünt. Amarvena sees Apex as god, while Mohrsmünt sees Praeda as a devil equivalent. This triad further complicates the predator-prey dynamic, adding a layer of spiritual ambiguity and shared reverence within the Ferra mythos.

Requiem, Romance with the hunt, no remorse, nickname for Apex

Sapphic nickname for Praeda, longing for love

In the Mythos of the Endless Hunt, as well as in the world of Toma, Apex and Praeda reincarnate as creatures engaged in a chase, however it is said that all Ferra contain this nature of the chase embedded within them. Apex and Praeda can manifest in physical forms throughout the world, but not without the manifestation of the other, seen within a chase. If Apex assumes the form of a primordial, she may knock down cliffsides in search of the agile Praeda that tends to stay one step ahead.

It is similar, and inspired, by Wile E. Coyote and Roadrunner.
