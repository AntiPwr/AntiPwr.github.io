**Bin**: [[Scape]]  
**Basin**: [[Sacrus]]  
**Eco**: [[Scape (TTRPG)/1 Purpose Taxonomy/Complete Taxonomy/02 Eco/01 Toman Ecoss/02 Toma/Toma]] ([[Babadoo Slim]]) of [[Toman Ecoss]]  
**Phylum**: [[Ashprahm]] (**Oshe**)

**Oshe** is a deeply mystical and occult subphylum of [[Ashprahm]], still actively practiced in [[New Badaba]] on the Isle of [[Babadoo Slim]]. It is the last remnant of the Ashprahm belief system on the island after the [[Battle of the Banquet]], a conflict that left most of the island’s spiritual landscape devastated. Oshe focuses on ritualistic practices, spirit invocation, and the interaction with natural and supernatural forces.

### **Beliefs and Practices**

Practitioners of Oshe seek to connect with spirits, ancestors, and natural forces through rituals involving offerings, sacrifices, and symbolic dances. This belief system is highly animistic, with a strong emphasis on the importance of spirits residing within animals, plants, and even objects. Many rituals within Oshe are designed to harness the power of these spirits, often for protection, guidance, or to bring about certain outcomes in the physical world.

Oshe followers are also deeply connected to the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. They believe that spirits can influence the living and that one's actions can resonate through generations, impacting both the present and the afterlife.

### **Cultural Significance**

Oshe remains an integral part of the undercurrent of spiritual life in New Badaba, even as the island is dominated by the more pragmatic and materialistic pursuits of piracy and commerce. Its followers are often seen as keepers of the island's spiritual roots, performing their rituals in hidden groves or on the shores of the island under the moonlight. Despite the decline of [[Ashprahm]] after the [[Tayim Trade Republic]]’s suppression of spiritual practices, Oshe persists as a living connection to the island's past.

### **Inspiration**

Oshe is inspired by **Afro-Caribbean** spiritual systems like **Santeria** and **Voodoo**. It draws from their rich traditions of spirit invocation, animism, and rituals designed to harness natural forces. Much like these systems, Oshe is filled with symbolic practices, a strong connection to ancestral spirits, and the use of offerings and sacrifices as a means of communication with the spiritual realm.
