# Purpose Taxonomy

**Purpose Taxonomy** is a living, evolving classification system that organizes all existence by the destinies, beliefs, and connections that shape reality. Designed for worldbuilders, wiki readers, and players alike, it bridges the metaphysical and the practical—serving as both a philosophy of consciousness and a tool for understanding the structures of life, society, and the soul across the universe of Toma.

Purpose Taxonomy arranges existence into a vertical hierarchy of taxons, from the grand scale of the universe down to the singular soul’s purpose. It defines everything from geography and government to faith, dimension, and the very nature of being. This system is not merely academic: it has shaped institutions, justified both unity and division, and has been a force for both enlightenment and oppression. Many have died for the knowledge it brings, and its misuse has led to suffering as well as progress.

At the core of Purpose Taxonomy is the recognition that every soul possesses a unique, quantized vision for the future—its intrinsic signature, termed **Kind (K, <, or >)**. This vision is considered static until it is set into motion. The dynamic aspect—the rate at which that vision is realized in the world—is called **Degree (D or ^)**. In short:

**Degree = Kind’s Rate of Actualization**

This interplay between the fixed vision and its actualization ultimately defines the soul’s realized destiny, or **Essa**.

### Taxonomic Ranks

Purpose Taxonomy comprises nine hierarchical ranks:

1. **[[Bin]]:** Universe
2. **[[Basin]]:** Dimension
3. **[[Eco]]:** Plane
4. **[[Kingdom]]:** Inhabitant (by Empire Function)
5. **[[Phylum]]:** Ideology
6. **[[Class]]:** Government
7. **[[Order]]:** Civilization
8. **[[Family]]:** Community
9. **[[Essa]]:** Soul’s Purpose

### Creation and Evolution

Purpose Taxonomy was conceived during the [[Taxotheir Line|Taxotheir Line]] by the Huma of Toma, born from the need to interpret the complex interplay of [[Evolution]], [[Belief]], and [[Anim]] in the Toman Ecoss. Some argue it began as a common language for interspecies unification—a lightweight system for expressing one’s connection to the world, allowing creatures of all kinds to communicate simple ideas without the burden of complex languages.

#### From Social to Purpose Taxonomy

The earliest form, known as **Taxotheir** or **Social Taxonomy**, emerged as societies sought to classify the world around them, their relationships, and their destinies. This system was shaped by the great Lines of Toman history:

- **Taxotheir Line:** Systematic classification began, driven by warfare over resources and the need for order in a chaotic world.
- **Cel Blindbirth Line:** The dominance of [[Celia]] forced Huma underground, transforming their society and deepening the need for a taxonomy that could explain both suffering and hope.
- **Line from Few:** As Huma and others reclaimed the surface, Purpose Taxonomy was revised to reflect new realities, beliefs, and the lessons of survival and adaptation.
- **Current Line:** The arrival of [[Automata]], the near-extinction of [[Primordials]], and the rise of new technologies have further evolved the taxonomy, making it a living system that adapts to the changing world.

Throughout these eras, Purpose Taxonomy has been both a tool for understanding and a weapon for control. It has enabled the growth of knowledge, but also justified division, hierarchy, and even atrocity. Some see it as a caste system; others as a path to harmony. Its true aim, however, is to recognize that every individual has worth, and that the study of purpose is a science of connection, not separation.

### Exception-Branching

When a creature does not neatly fit a taxon category, its classification is marked as "EB" (Exception-Branching). For example, a human fighter following a unique religious philosophy might be designated "EB" until further evidence supports a more standard categorization, or it branches into its own categorization. This could also be understood with the idea of a forming government, which may or may not develop into a state of uniqueness.

### Contested Claims

In the context of Purpose Taxonomy, **Contested Claims** refer to both taxons (the categories themselves) and taxon members (the specific inputs within a rank, such as cities, species, ideologies, etc.) whose existence, definition, or legitimacy is actively debated, disputed, or not universally accepted across societies. A contested taxon or member may be commonplace and accepted in one civilization, while being denied, suppressed, or even forbidden in another. The reasons for contestation are diverse: public or private debate, legal doctrine, religious law, cultural taboo, or the influence of powerful groups and institutions. Some are suffused with law and doctrine, while others are marginalized or erased from official records.

Although every taxon or member is likely to be questioned by at least a few individuals, the "contested" tag in Purpose Taxonomy highlights those disputes that are significant at the level of civilizations, states, or major powers—where the flow and dissemination of information, knowledge, and [[belief]] are shaped by ongoing struggles for authority and meaning. The presence of a contested claim signals that the classification is not merely a matter of scientific or philosophical debate, but is entangled with the broader dynamics of power, culture, and history in the world of Toma.

Generally, when a contested claim is marked on this site, it will refer to a taxon member (such as a specific city, species, or ideology). However, on this page and on other taxon pages (such as the [[Bin]], [[Basin]], or [[Eco]] page), contested taxons themselves may be discussed, reflecting the larger disputes over the structure and legitimacy of the classification system as a whole.

**Purpose Taxonomy** is a classification system designed to organize life by its connected belief structures and destinies across the universe. It arranges existence into a vertical hierarchy of taxons—ranging from the grand scale of the universe down to the singular soul’s purpose—that define everything from geography and government to faith and dimension. Importantly, the Kingdom is only one taxon among many.

At the core of this system is the recognition that every soul possesses a unique, quantized vision for the future—its intrinsic signature, termed **Kind (K or >)**. This vision is static until it is set into motion. The dynamic aspect—the rate at which that vision is realized in the world—is called **Degree (D or ^)**. In short:

> **Degree = Kind’s Rate of Actualization**

This interplay between the fixed vision and its actualization ultimately defines the soul’s realized destiny, or **Essa**.

### Taxonomic Ranks

Purpose Taxonomy comprises nine hierarchical ranks:

1. **Bin**: Universe
2. **Basin**: Dimension
3. **Eco**: Plane
4. **Kingdom**: Inhabitant (by Empire Function)
5. **Phylum**: Ideology
6. **Class**: Government
7. **Order**: Civilization
8. **Family**: Community
9. **Essa**: Soul’s Purpose (the realized destiny, influenced by the rate of actualization)

### Creation and Evolution

- **Creation:**  
    Conceived during the [[Taxotheir Line|Taxotheir Line]] by the Huma of Toma, Purpose Taxonomy was developed to interpret the complex interplay of [[Evolution]], [[Belief]], and [[Anim]] in the Toman Ecoss. Although initially designed as a language for simpler kingdoms, its principles extend to all life—even if categorizations may shift as beliefs evolve.
    
- **Social Taxonomy:**  
    Revised during the [[Line from Few|Line from Few]] after the [[Cel Blindbirth Line|Cel Blindbirth Line]], Social Taxonomy now exists in three forms:
    
    1. **Taxotheir Taxonomy** – pre-Blindbirth understanding
    2. **Current Taxonomy** – reflective of the contemporary timeline
    3. **Complete Taxonomy** – linking to a broader comprehension of the Scape (macrocosm understanding)

### Classification Template

When recording a note, only the necessary taxons are included. The left-hand labels are bolded (unlinked), while the right-hand entries link to the related notes. For example:

**Classification Template**

- **Bin**: [[Ex. Bin]]
- **Basin**: [[Ex. Basin]]
- **Eco**: [[Ex. Eco]] ([[Ex. Location]], [[Ex. Region]], [[Ex. Continent]]) of [[Ex. Ecoss]]
- **Kingdom**: [[Ex. Kingdom 1]] and [[Ex. Kingdom 2]]
- **Phylum**: [[Ex. Phylum]]
- **Class**: [[Ex. Class]]
- **Order**: [[Ex. Order]]
- **Family**: [[Ex. Family]]
- **Essa**: [[Ex. Essa]]

### Exception-Branching

When a creature does not neatly fit a taxon category, its classification is marked as "EB" (Exception-Branching). For example, a human fighter following a unique religious philosophy might be designated "EB" until further evidence supports a more standard categorization.

### Connection to Origin

[[Origin]], found at the center of each basin follows a similar goal of finding each individual's purpose through the development and mapping of the [[Scapia Sangam]], a universal map of all life and its interdependencies.

Spira’s reason could be change as they carry time with them and are energy. They also reincarnate or find host in the nonliving elements, the people see this as Natura but it is not its own kingdom.
