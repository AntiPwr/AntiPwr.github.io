# Purpose Taxonomy

**Purpose Taxonomy** is a living, evolving classification system that organizes all existence by the destinies, beliefs, and connections that shape reality. Designed for worldbuilders, wiki readers, and players alike, it bridges the metaphysical and the practical—serving as both a philosophy of consciousness and a tool for understanding the structures of life, society, and the soul across the universe of Toma.

Purpose Taxonomy arranges existence into a vertical hierarchy of taxons, from the grand scale of the universe down to the singular soul’s purpose. It defines everything from geography and government to faith, dimension, and the very nature of being. This system is not merely academic: it has shaped institutions, justified both unity and division, and has been a force for both enlightenment and oppression. Many have died for the knowledge it brings, and its misuse has led to suffering as well as progress.

At the core of Purpose Taxonomy is the recognition that every soul possesses a unique, quantized vision for the future—its intrinsic signature, termed **Kind (K, <, or >)**. This vision is considered static until it is set into motion. The dynamic aspect—the rate at which that vision is realized in the world—is called **Degree (D or ^)**. In short:

**Degree = Kind’s Rate of Actualization**

This interplay between the fixed vision and its actualization ultimately defines the soul’s realized destiny, or **Essa**.

### Taxonomic Ranks

Purpose Taxonomy comprises nine hierarchical ranks:

1. **[[Bin]]:** Universe
2. **[[Basin]]:** Dimension
3. **[[Eco]]:** Plane
4. **[[Kingdom]]:** Inhabitant (by Empire Function)
5. **[[Phylum]]:** Ideology
6. **[[Class]]:** Government
7. **[[Order]]:** Civilization
8. **[[Family]]:** Community
9. **[[Essa]]:** Soul’s Purpose

### Creation and Evolution

Purpose Taxonomy was conceived during the [[Taxotheir Line|Taxotheir Line]] by the Huma of Toma, born from the need to interpret the complex interplay of [[Evolution]], [[Belief]], and [[Anim]] in the Toman Ecoss. Some argue it began as a common language for interspecies unification—a lightweight system for expressing one’s connection to the world, allowing creatures of all kinds to communicate simple ideas without the burden of complex languages.

#### From Social to Purpose Taxonomy

The earliest form, known as **Taxotheir** or **Social Taxonomy**, emerged as societies sought to classify the world around them, their relationships, and their destinies. This system was shaped by the great Lines of Toman history:

- **Taxotheir Line:** Systematic classification began, driven by warfare over resources and the need for order in a chaotic world.
- **Cel Blindbirth Line:** The dominance of [[Celia]] forced Huma underground, transforming their society and deepening the need for a taxonomy that could explain both suffering and hope.
- **Line from Few:** As Huma and others reclaimed the surface, Purpose Taxonomy was revised to reflect new realities, beliefs, and the lessons of survival and adaptation.
- **Current Line:** The arrival of [[Automata]], the near-extinction of [[Primordials]], and the rise of new technologies have further evolved the taxonomy, making it a living system that adapts to the changing world.

Throughout these eras, Purpose Taxonomy has been both a tool for understanding and a weapon for control. It has enabled the growth of knowledge, but also justified division, hierarchy, and even atrocity. Some see it as a caste system; others as a path to harmony. Its true aim, however, is to recognize that every individual has worth, and that the study of purpose is a science of connection, not separation.

### Exception-Branching

When a creature does not neatly fit a taxon category, its classification is marked as "EB" (Exception-Branching). For example, a human fighter following a unique religious philosophy might be designated "EB" until further evidence supports a more standard categorization, or it branches into its own categorization. This could also be understood with the idea of a forming government, which may or may not develop into a state of uniqueness.

### Contested Claims

In the context of Purpose Taxonomy, **Contested Claims** refer to both taxons (the categories themselves) and taxon members (the specific inputs within a rank, such as cities, species, ideologies, etc.) whose existence, definition, or legitimacy is actively debated, disputed, or not universally accepted across societies. A contested taxon or member may be commonplace and accepted in one civilization, while being denied, suppressed, or even forbidden in another. The reasons for contestation are diverse: public or private debate, legal doctrine, religious law, cultural taboo, or the influence of powerful groups and institutions. Some are suffused with law and doctrine, while others are marginalized or erased from official records.

Although every taxon or member is likely to be questioned by at least a few individuals, the "contested" tag in Purpose Taxonomy highlights those disputes that are significant at the level of civilizations, states, or major powers—where the flow and dissemination of information, knowledge, and [[belief]] are shaped by ongoing struggles for authority and meaning. The presence of a contested claim signals that the classification is not merely a matter of scientific or philosophical debate, but is entangled with the broader dynamics of power, culture, and history in the world of Toma.

Generally, when a contested claim is marked on this site, it will refer to a taxon member (such as a specific city, species, or ideology). However, on this page and on other taxon pages (such as the [[Bin]], [[Basin]], or [[Eco]] page), contested taxons themselves may be discussed, reflecting the larger disputes over the structure and legitimacy of the classification system as a whole.
