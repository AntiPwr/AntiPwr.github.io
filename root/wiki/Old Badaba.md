**Bin**: [[Scape]]  
**Basin**: [[Sacrus]]  
**Eco**: [[Scape (TTRPG)/1 Purpose Taxonomy/Complete Taxonomy/02 Eco/01 Toman Ecoss/02 Toma/Toma]] ([[Babadoo Slim]]) of [[Toman Ecoss]]  
**Kingdom**: [[Huma]]

**Class**: [[Tayim Trade Republic]]  
**Order**: **Old Badaba**

**Old Badaba** was initially established as an agricultural imperialist settlement by the [[Tayim Trade Republic]] on the Isle of [[Babadoo Slim]]. The settlement's purpose was twofold: to expand the influence of the [[Ashprahm]] religion and to provide a sustainable food source for the impoverished lower classes of [[Tayim]]. The fertile lands of [[Babadoo Slim]] were seen as a potential solution to the Republic’s growing hunger crisis, while the settlement served as a strategic foothold for the spread of Ashprahm’s conservative religious doctrines.

### History and Purpose

Founded as an agricultural hub, Old Badaba was designed to exploit the island’s rich, tropical landscape for crop cultivation, intended to feed the lower classes of Tayim while bolstering the island’s economic and religious ties to the Republic. The settlement was also a crucial part of the Republic’s vision to spread the Ashprahm faith, which preached strict adherence to spiritual hierarchies and the control of primal forces in nature. The people of Old Badaba were tasked with not only tending the land but also with reinforcing the ideals of Ashprahm as a way of life for future generations on the island.

However, this colonial effort was met with resistance from the island’s native and imported populations, particularly the New World Simi and other disillusioned groups who saw the settlement as a tool of oppression. The growing discontent led to a schism between those who embraced Ashprahm’s teachings and the burgeoning ideologies of Primalism, Advancism, and the native belief system of [[Pria]], which centered on spiritual freedom and resistance against imperial control.

### The Battle of the Banquet

Old Badaba’s fate was sealed during the infamous [[Battle of the Banquet]], a revolt that erupted during a supposed peace banquet held between the rebellious factions and the ruling powers of the Republic. The conflict quickly escalated into a full-scale rebellion against the Republic’s control over the island’s resources and spiritual beliefs. The settlement was razed by the Republic’s forces in retaliation, and Old Badaba was left in ruins, its once-thriving fields reduced to desolation.

The destruction of Old Badaba marked the beginning of the end for the Tayim Trade Republic's influence on Babadoo Slim. The event sparked the formation of [[New Badaba]], a new settlement that rose from the ashes of its predecessor, now governed by the [[Hacienda Band]] and shaped by the ideologies of Pria and Advancism, which rejected the Republic’s strict adherence to Ashprahm.

### Agriculture and Legacy

Though Old Badaba was destroyed, its agricultural infrastructure remained. The ruins of the settlement became the foundation for New Badaba’s innovative farming system, with its flooded ruins transformed into fertile floating fields. These fields are now the backbone of New Badaba’s economy, symbolizing the persistence of the island’s people in the face of oppression and destruction.

### Religious Shifts

Old Badaba’s destruction also marked the decline of Ashprahm on Babadoo Slim. The once-dominant religion was largely purged from the island, leaving behind only remnants, such as the occult practices of [[Oshe]]. The new religious landscape, dominated by Pria, represents the spiritual rebellion against Ashprahm's conservative dogma, further severing the island’s ties to the Tayim Trade Republic.

### Inspiration

The story of Old Badaba is inspired by the historical use of colonial agricultural settlements as tools of imperial expansion and religious conversion. Like many real-world agricultural colonies, Old Badaba was both an economic venture and a cultural imposition, intended to control the land and the people through resource extraction and religious indoctrination. The rebellion that led to its destruction reflects the resistance of indigenous and oppressed peoples to colonial rule, particularly in regions where agriculture and religion were used as mechanisms of control.
