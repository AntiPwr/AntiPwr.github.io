**Kingdom**: **Monstra**

"You cannot run from your fears, you can only strive not to become them."

**Monstra** are a **[[Kingdom]]** specifically designed to counteract the intelligence and versatility of the **[[Huma]]** kingdom. Monstra are the physical embodiments of Huma’s shortcomings, reflecting their deepest fears. Just as Huma pose a significant challenge to Monstra’s growth, Monstra present an equally severe threat to the progress of Huma civilizations. Competition for limited resources and Monstra's destructive nature act as significant barriers to Huma’s expansion and evolution.

# Origin

Monstra were created as the manifestation of the negative aspects of Huma intelligence—**fear**. Each Submonstra represents a unique fear from within the Huma psyche, designed to emerge and inflict that fear back upon the Huma themselves. Monstra are not merely antagonists but are intrinsic reflections of Huma's inner turmoil and vulnerabilities.

# Purpose Marking

Monstra’s [[Purpose Marking]] directly opposes that of the Huma. While Huma carry their Purpose Lines on their right hand, symbolizing growth and creation, Monstra bear theirs on the left hand. Furthermore, the Monstra Purpose Lines are flipped in comparison to the Huma's, symbolizing the destructive and fearful aspects that are the antithesis of the Huma's rise.

This opposite Purpose Line visually represents the duality between the two kingdoms, reflecting the eternal struggle between creation and destruction, growth and fear. The Monstra Purpose Line acts as a reminder that every step forward by the Huma is met with an opposing force that seeks to drag them back into fear and chaos.

# Intelligence

Monstra are generally **[[Middle-minded]]**, but they can shift to lower states of intelligence, such as **[[Simple-minded]]** or **[[Compul-minded]]**, especially when resonating with the fears they embody. Their intelligence is fluid, adapting to how closely they align with the specific fears they are meant to instill in Huma.

# Submonstra

- **[[Votim]]**
- **[[Phab’Ix]]**
- **[[Goblin]]** (Manipulation/Scam)
- **[[Orc]]**
- **[[Phobos]]**
- **[[Timor]]**
- **[[Junkie]]** (Addiction/Overdose)
- [[Gnoll]] (Savagery)
- Kenku (Misinformation)

Each of these Submonstra embody a specific fear, acting as a direct challenge to the Huma’s desire to rise above their baser instincts. As Huma evolve, so too do Monstra, finding new ways to adapt to their fears and remain a constant threat.

# Inspiration

The concept of Monstra was inspired by **Shawn Coss’s Feartober Series**, which visualizes fears as grotesque, monstrous entities. This artistic depiction of fear serves as the basis for how Monstra physically and psychologically impact the Huma, challenging them to confront the darkest parts of themselves.

Monstra are not merely villains—they are the manifestation of internal fear given form, reminding the Huma that their rise is always threatened by what lies beneath.







Principal Fear







"I feel like the strings have been cut, for the lack of a better word."

A huma transformation into monstra occurs with a fair share of mental health issues. Depersonalization episodes, coping with short-term, low-effort, low-empathy lifestyle.
