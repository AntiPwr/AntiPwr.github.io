The Walkers of Duality are a small class under the [[Innerdualism]] phylum. Walkers sparsely populate Toma, but tend to find themselves in powerful positions within their own right.





# Soul Dilation

The Walkers of Duality use [[Soul Anatomy#Mollica Dilation|Mollica Dilation]] to enhance their connection to the [[Soul Fields]] during meditation. This allows them to increase the speed of their mind to have twice as much time to process complex information received from [[Nesa]] and [[Spira]].
