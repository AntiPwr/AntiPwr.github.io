In the [[Toman Ecoss]], Anim represents the essence of life, magic, and consciousness. This vital force flows through the blood of all living beings, influencing their abilities, interactions, and very existence within the realm. Anim is divided into two distinct states: **Animus**, which is internalized within the body, and **Anima**, which is released from the body. The distinction between these states reflects the duality of life in Toma, where belief and intention constantly shape reality.

Since Anim can only exist in these two states, the Soul Fields are heavily influenced by the balance or ratio of Animus to Anima.

### Nature of Anim

Anim is both a physical and metaphysical substance, acting as the life force that permeates all beings in Toma. It serves as a bridge between the material plane and the [[Soul Fields]], sustaining existence and enabling extraordinary abilities. Generated through the conversion of belief, Anim allows creatures to transform their convictions into tangible force, which can be harnessed for magical and physical actions. The energy is fluid and adaptable, constantly interacting with a creature’s [[Belief Pool|Belief Pool]] and environment, adjusting to changes in perception and intent.

### Creation and Flow of Anim

Anim circulates through a creature's body, originating in the [[Pith]]—a multidimensional structure that regulates its flow. Receptors on the body absorb Anima from the environment, directing it into the Purge. The brain generates belief, which is converted into Animus within the Purge. As Animus flows through the body, it empowers creatures to manifest their will and intentions. When expended, Animus becomes Anima, exiting the body and interacting with the external world. The bloodstream acts as a network for storing and distributing Animus, delivering energy throughout the body and enabling the feats of magic and strength that define life in the Toman Ecoss.

### Anim Synthesis

In the Soul Fields, Anim is created through a process known as Anim Synthesis. Here, [[Spira]] feast on [[Belief Pool|Belief Pools]], converting belief into Anim, which is then imbued with the qualities and intentions of those beliefs. The synthesis involves the absorption of belief by Spira, who transform it into Animus, ready to be harnessed within the body and released as Anima. The potency of a creature's beliefs directly affects their ability to use magic, with stronger beliefs resulting in more powerful magical capabilities.

### Influence of Anim

Anim forms the foundation of all magical abilities, influencing not only the potency and nature of spells but also the individual's interaction with their environment. As Anima interacts with the external world, it can cause changes that reflect the beliefs and intentions of the individual, leading to phenomena such as altered weather patterns, vibrant plant growth, or the creation of unique magical effects. Socially, Anim plays a significant role, with strong belief-based Anima influencing how individuals are perceived and how they perceive others. This can affect relationships, social standing, and even political power.

### Anim Exhaustion

The use of Anim comes with risks. Excessive use can lead to exhaustion, resulting in severe mental and physical health consequences. Symptoms of Anim exhaustion include sensory distortions, such as color blindness or auditory distortions, and in extreme cases, organ failure or death. Individuals who overextend themselves in the use of Anim may experience a weakened connection to the [[Soul Fields]], leading to disorientation and memory loss.

### Role in the Scape

Anim is the central force within the Toman Ecoss, driving the interactions between belief, magic, and reality. It serves as the bridge between the material and metaphysical, shaping the experiences and capabilities of all creatures. Constantly evolving, Anim reflects the changing beliefs and dynamics of the world, influencing the very fabric of existence and enabling the extraordinary feats of those who dwell within the Toman Ecoss.
