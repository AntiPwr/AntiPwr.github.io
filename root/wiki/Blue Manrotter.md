## Description

The Blue Manrotter grows in water, anchored by a thin, flowy stem with a vertical white ribbon or pruny texture. Its cap is wide and circular, able to bend at the perimeter both up and down—forming a dome underwater or a capsule-like ball above water. These mushrooms are found at the shallow edges of creeks, rivers, and other waterways throughout the Clutched Forest.

## Life Cycle and Feeding

Blue Manrotters thrive on the abundance of creatures that die searching for freshwater in the forest. They spread their spores downstream, ensuring they can capture decaying corpses for nourishment. When a carcass is present, the mushroom bends its cap to envelop and consume it—downward for aquatic creatures, upward for land animals. Excess nutrients from a decaying body can be shared with nearby manrotters through their connected stems.

## Rituals and Bioluminescence

It is a ritual in the Clutched Forest, especially among the [[Tildohsi Partition]] and other local peoples, to offer small animals to the Blue Manrotter. As the mushroom consumes the offering, it quickly releases bioluminescent blue spores, visible as glowing streams in the water. These spores heat the water and serve as guides through the dark forest, where the canopy blocks moonlight. Celial springs—ponds or rivers with many manrotters—are sites of constant decay and renewal, with the mushrooms releasing more spores when consuming live creatures than plant matter. This rapid spore release is a survival tactic for enduring harsh winters, when fewer corpses are available.

## Hivemind and Mycelial Communication

Blue Manrotters form extensive hiveminds through waterways and mycelial networks, especially in the narrow streams, brooks, and creeks of the Clutched Forest. Their colonies begin at the sources of these waterways, transferring spores and silent mycelial communication downstream. This allows Blue Manrotters to share nutrients, coordinate growth, and respond collectively to environmental changes. Their form of silent, distributed mycelial communication is notably similar to the communication and governance system of the [[Tildohsi Partition]], making them a subject of fascination and reverence among local peoples.

## Dangers and Folklore

The Blue Manrotter is infamous for its seductive and deadly properties: those weakened or near death who drink spore-heated water are slowly consumed from within, eventually compelled to return to the mushroom to offer their body for rebirth. Folklore tells of Blue Manrotters assuming [[Huma]] forms in celial springs, luring bathers to their deaths. While some claim to have escaped this fate, such stories are difficult to verify.
