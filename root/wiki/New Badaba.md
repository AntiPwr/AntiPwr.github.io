**New Badaba** is an expansive coastal city located on the Isle of [[Babadoo Slim]], emerging from the ruins of [[Old Badaba]], a once-thriving city destroyed by the [[Tayim Trade Republic]] during the [[Battle of the Banquet]]. This battle was a direct response to a rebellion spurred by rising tensions between the ideologies of **[[Primalism and Advancism|Primalism, Advancism]]** and **[[Gludestit]]**, which sought to break away from the cultural imperialism of the Trade Republic.

### Agriculture and Economy

New Badaba’s agricultural success lies within the flooded remnants of Old Badaba, where the ruins have been transformed into a thriving hub for the island’s floating farming system. Using the old structures as a foundation, these floating fields produce abundant fruit crops, providing a vital economic backbone for the island. Though the public face of New Badaba appears to revolve around legal trade, the real wealth of the island is deeply rooted in piracy and the illicit trafficking of exotic animals, particularly [[Primordial]]s.

The **[[Hacienda Band]]**, New Badaba’s ruling class, maintains control over both the agricultural sector and the black-market dealings, profiting from piracy while publicly distancing themselves from it. The **[[Oshe]]**, a remnant of the [[Ashprahm]] subphylum, also plays a quiet yet significant role in the daily life and undercurrents of New Badaba’s society.

### Culture

The city’s cultural identity is shaped by the clash of ideologies that led to the destruction of Old Badaba. The combination of deep-rooted occult beliefs from the Oshe (Ashprahm) and the rapidly growing **[[Pria]]** belief system (a subphylum of Gludestit) created a spiritual backdrop for the city’s inhabitants. These ideologies, developed from the rebellion against the Tayim Trade Republic’s cultural and religious impositions, now define the spiritual life of New Badaba.

Piracy and rebellion still define much of New Badaba’s identity. The people of the city live with a fierce sense of independence and mistrust toward external influences. Although lawlessness thrives in the shadows, the **[[Hacienda Band]]** keeps both pirates and citizens in a delicate balance, ensuring the survival of the city.

### Inspiration

New Badaba's agricultural system draws from the **Chinampas** method of floating gardens. The historical context of New Badaba reflects the conflicts between **colonizers** and **indigenous** populations in the **Caribbean** and **Latin American** regions, where rebellion, imperialism, and piracy shaped local societies. The tension between Primalism and Advancism mimics the cultural clash of advancing technological ideologies against naturalistic belief systems. Additionally, the occult beliefs in Oshe are inspired by **Santeria** and **Voodoo**, both having **syncretic African** and Caribbean religious influences.
