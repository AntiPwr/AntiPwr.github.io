# Chain of Delta
_the Lasting Change, East Wind ([[Current Line]])_

The **Chain of Delta** is a dominant and authoritarian government power throughout [[Wyldere]], with its capital order, [[Delta]], located in the southern territory of [[Vokar]]. Led by the calculating and enigmatic [[Fuscia Lustin]], the regime maintains control through a combination of his personal leadership as [[Medan]] (Archangel) and the rule of the [[Chain Triarch]] who govern the three [[Omep regions]] with an iron fist. The Chain enforces strict social hierarchy, uses photometal implants to suppress dissent, and relies on both military force and substance distribution to maintain order. Its influence shapes all of Wyldere, especially in Vokar, where the state's power is most deeply entrenched.

## Structure and Governance
### Capital Order: Delta
[[Delta]] is a technologically advanced yet deeply corrupt Order within the Toman Ecoss, ruled by the totalitarian regime known as the Chain of Delta. Delta prioritizes efficiency and productivity above all else, often at the cost of its citizens’ well-being. The state uses Natura to generate electricity, fueling rapid industrial growth while creating pollution pits and environmental hazards. Governance is heavily militarized, especially within its three Omep Region sectors, each ruled by autocrats aligned with Fuscia Lustin. The poorest sector, Rasm, lies at the northern edge, while Almalek borders the Swirling Sea to the south. The eastern sector is a militarized zone reserved for government and military operations, strictly controlled and requiring enhanced Photometal implants for entry. This sector also houses one of Delta’s two exits, a heavily guarded route only accessible with explicit government permission.

Delta operates a tightly controlled society where citizens must apply for jobs through the government, which dictates their place of residence and social standing. The edge of the plane is used as an artificial border to conserve resources, with the poorest regions forced to live near this inhospitable boundary. Photometal implants are integral to this control, used extensively to track and monitor the population. These implants are taught as a religious rite of Klesn, symbolizing a ward against societal pollution, but in truth serve as tools for government surveillance, binding citizens to the state and suppressing dissent.

Estal Link is the affluent region of Delta, stretching from the port to the city center, where the Illid Munis is located. This area is the only part of Delta that engages in both import and export trade, with its open market accessible only to those with citizenship in the Chain of Delta. During specific times of the year, Estal Link opens to global trade, presenting Delta as a prosperous and well-ordered city. In reality, the wealth of Estal Link is built on the suffering and exploitation of the Omep Region regions, which are closed off to outsiders.

A key aspect of Delta’s internal economy and social control is the secret operation known as MExtrema. Under this program, the government produces and distributes various drugs through third-party vendors, perceived as unaffiliated with the state. This operation controls the population by fostering addiction and identifies the most successful drug users in society, who are studied to replicate their traits in others, much like Fuscia Lustin has done with his own drug use.

Delta’s military is infamous for its use of drugs in combat, making its soldiers unpredictable and terrifying. The drugs administered enhance endurance, aggression, and pain tolerance, giving them a significant advantage. This chemically enhanced force is a cornerstone of Delta’s security, deterring threats and maintaining dominance in the region.

Beneath the surface, Delta is a society built on deception, control, and exploitation. The power grid, seen as a marvel of Fuscia Lustin's leadership, is actually a product of extreme cruelty towards the Electricity Natura. The leader's public persona as a champion of progress and innovation masks the horrific truth of how the city's power is maintained. Delta appears to thrive, but is rotting from within due to the corruption and moral decay of its leadership.

### Chain Triarch
The [[Chain Triarch]] is the ruling body composed of three autocrats, each governing one of the [[Omep Region]]s. While they appear to operate independently, they are closely aligned and communicate constantly to enforce the will of [[Fuscia Lustin]]. Each Triarch ruler is called an [[Arch]].

**Current Triarchs:**
- [[Isaheim Maddows]] ([[Almalek]])
- [[Selyman Oth]] ([[Rasm]])
- [[Aj'iru]] ([[Kleznit]])

An [[Arch]] is an Omep Region [[Chain Triarch]] leader within the Chain of Delta. The Triarch’s structure is designed to maintain a firm grip on the population, with each region strategically positioned to reinforce the regime’s control. The Triarch also plays a key role in the perpetuation of myths and the orchestration of political events, such as the Stallach coup.

### The Role of the Medan
The [[Medan]] is the supreme leader of the Chain Triarch, responsible for overseeing the entire operation and ensuring the regime’s stability. The Medan secures domestic ties, manages the distribution of power among the Triarch, and acts as the central authority in Delta. This position is crucial for maintaining the clandestine government and orchestrating the manipulation of both the population and the Triarch members themselves. Medan translates to Archangel, signifying both spiritual and political authority.

### Omep Regions
The Omep Regions are three militarized districts outside of Estal Link, all within the territory of Delta. These regions are heavily controlled by autocrats loyal to Fuscia Lustin, each governing their respective sectors with an iron fist. The Omep Regions are a stark contrast to the wealth and prosperity of Estal Link, with the people living under constant surveillance, control, and fear. The government's use of Photometal to track and monitor the population ensures that no one can escape their grip.

#### Rasm
The northwestern and poorest region, bordered by the edge of the plane to the west and the Vok Wall to the north. Rasm is a harsh, desolate area where survival is a daily struggle. The people of Rasm live in extreme poverty, with little access to resources or opportunities. The government’s control over Rasm is absolute, with the region being heavily militarized to prevent any attempts at rebellion or escape. This is the production center of Delta.

#### Almalek
The second poorest region, located to the southwest of the Estal Link and bordered by the ocean to the south. Almalek is ruled by Isaheim Maddows, a necromancer who uses a skeletal military force to maintain control. The people of Almalek live in fear of Isaheim and his undead soldiers, with many having resigned themselves to a life of oppression and despair. This region maintains agricultural and resource-harvesting requirements.

#### Kleznit
The northeastern Omep region, reserved for government and military operations. This area is strictly controlled, with access granted only to those with 3rd level Photometal implants. The Military District houses one of Delta’s two exits, a heavily guarded route that is only accessible with explicit government permission. This region serves as the nerve center of Delta’s military power, with its soldiers being heavily drugged and conditioned to obey orders without question.

## Command Structure, Military Ranks, Chain Population Terminology

The military hierarchy of the Chain of Delta mirrors that of the [[Kleznit Advance]], blending political, spiritual, and martial authority. The presence of [[Feignedfolk]] and the use of advanced photometal implants further distinguish the Chain’s forces from those of other regions.

The Chain of Delta follows a strict military hierarchy, with each rank reflecting a blend of political, spiritual, and martial authority:

### Tier I — Divine Authority
**Medan – Archangel of Delta:** Supreme Commander of all military and spiritual operations. (Currently [[Fuscia Lustin]])

**Saint-of-Purpose – Wartime Apostle:** Rare spiritual commander, extension of the Medan’s will (e.g., [[Kee]]).

**Arch – First Anchor:** Regional warlord and governor-general of an Omep region, subordinate to the Medan and Saint of Purpose. (Currently [[Aj'iru]], [[Isaheim Maddows]], [[Selyman Oth]])

### Tier II — Judgment Command
**Vicar:** Overseer of doctrinal warfare, propaganda, adversarial social engineering, and photometal development.

**Cladkin:** Commander of major war theaters and campaigns.

**Saint (Systems Tactician):** Senior logistics and supply tactician.

**Solutioner:** Oversees Death Marches and morale in failed sectors.

### Tier III — Chain Captains & Mech Armor Ranks
**Grand Officer:** Elite guide and commander, often chosen for intelligence over brute strength. Grand Officers are typically selected from the successful population of Rasm, not Almalek, and are given specialized training that skips the standard physical regimen. They are equipped with advanced mech armor and have the authority to lead other foot units in combat, especially in harsh winter conditions and the snowy sheets of Wyldere, as well as the Summons Mountain Range. Grand Officers are valued for their strategic acumen and adaptability, making them essential during large-scale operations in extreme environments.

**Grand Admiral:** The highest mech armor rank, personally chosen by the Medan or Arch. The Grand Admiral commands the most advanced mechanized units and is responsible for leading major offensives and critical missions. This rank is reserved for those who have demonstrated exceptional leadership and tactical skill. Grand Admirals are rare and serve as the ultimate authority among the mechanized forces of the Chain.

Grand Officers and Grand Admirals are distinct from other ranks in that their training and selection process is tailored to their unique roles. Grand Officers, in particular, bypass the grueling physical training endured by most soldiers from Almalek, instead focusing on advanced strategy, technology, and command. In contrast, nearly all soldiers from Almalek are subjected to intense physical regimens, preparing them for frontline combat—a harsh experience, though often considered an improvement over life in their home region. The Grand Admiral, as the highest mechanized rank, is a direct extension of the Medan or Arch’s authority and is responsible for the most critical missions and offensives.

**Serrat:** Division commander of drugged infantry.

**Splicer:** Officer of mixed-kingdom [[resonance]] units.

**Gate Phaser:** Controls military exits and movement in/out of Delta.

**Warden:** Operations officer for internal security and detention.

### Tier V — Rank-and-File
**Chainlink:** Standard drug-conditioned soldier.

Chainlink is an omnipresent role within the Chain of Delta. Once achieved, a Chainlink can be promoted or assigned to any other military role. Every Chainlink is always paired with exactly two other partners, forming a triad that balances training, operational duties, and personal development. This system is designed to build strong, resilient connections between soldiers and military personnel, fostering loyalty and mutual reliance. No two military personnel share the same two partners; each triad is unique. The process of forming these triads begins early in military training, with recruits often pulled from Rasm and Almalek and assigned to their lifelong partners from the outset of their service.

**Flashplate:** Shock infantry for rebellion suppression and territory capture.

**Claspbearer:** Guard of political officers and relics.

**Link:** Trainee, often from Rasm or Almalek.

---

### Tier Null — Unofficial/Shadow Ranks

**Crank:** Destroys heretical targets through self-destructive acts.

**Bleaker:** One-way mission operative, presumed dead on dispatch.

## Will-Suppression, Social Engineering, and Feignedfolk

The discipline and loyalty of the Chain of Delta are enforced not only through physical training and execution lines, but also through advanced psychological conditioning and magical control. [[Credomancy]] is used to suppress the will of both soldiers and Feignedfolk, ensuring absolute obedience. The integration of Feignedfolk—entities lacking true willpower—into the ranks is a hallmark of the Chain’s military doctrine, reflecting the regime’s broader strategy of will-suppression and social engineering as described in [[Kleznit Advance]].

The Medan and the Triarchs are both practitioners and enforcers of these methods, working closely with the Medan to maintain the unity and effectiveness of the Chain’s military. The result is a force that is both feared and respected across Wyldere, known for its unwavering discipline and the seamless integration of human and non-human soldiers.

As a continental army, the Chain of Delta is infamous for its ruthless enforcement of discipline and loyalty on the battlefield. When the army advances—often across the open, snow-laden plains of Wyldere—a strict military execution line is established behind the main force. This line is composed of elite spellsnipers and loyal militants whose sole duty is to eliminate any soldier who attempts to defect, retreat without orders, or otherwise betray the Chain. The presence of this execution line ensures that allegiance to the state is absolute and that the security of information and military cohesion is never compromised.

Desertion is considered one of the deepest forms of treason within the Chain of Delta, punishable by immediate death. The execution line is both a psychological and physical barrier, reinforcing the doctrine that the will of the Chain is paramount and that individual survival is always subordinate to the unity and secrecy of the military. This system, while brutal, is credited with maintaining the legendary discipline and fearsome reputation of the Chain of Delta throughout the continent.

## Feignedfolk

Feignedfolk are all populations within the Chain that lack true willpower. This includes Willed-Mecha, undead creatures (a type of subautomata), necrorobotics (soulless inanimate matter simulating life), and enslaved creatures (who, though possessing will, are so suppressed that Delta considers them part of the feign population). The general population is increasingly moving toward feignedfolk status due to Fuscia Lustin's exceptional social engineering and the regime's manipulation of belief and autonomy. Feignedfolk exist on both extremes of the social hierarchy within Delta, from the most controlled laborers to the most elite, will-suppressed enforcers.

### Necromancy
Necromancy is the domain of Isaheim Maddows and the region of Almalek. It involves the reanimation and control of the dead, creating undead laborers and soldiers (subautomata) who serve the Chain without will or autonomy. Necromancy is a key tool for resource extraction and maintaining order in Almalek.

### Robotics
Robotics is centered in Rasm, where the production and management of Automata and Willed-Mecha is paramount. These constructs are engineered for efficiency and obedience, lacking true will and serving as the backbone of Delta's industrial and logistical might.

### Necrorobotics
Necrorobotics exists at the intersection of necromancy and robotics, combining soulless inanimate matter with necromantic and mechanical processes to simulate life. These entities are neither fully undead nor fully mechanical, but are used for specialized labor and enforcement roles where both resilience and adaptability are required.

### Credomancy
Credomancy is the political and spiritual manipulation of belief and will, led by the [[Medan]] (currently [[Fuscia Lustin]]) and the [[Saint of Purpose]]. Through advanced social engineering, propaganda, and ritual, the regime exerts control over the minds and choices of the population, suppressing autonomy and guiding individuals into roles and behaviors that serve the Chain. This form of influence is so powerful that it can render the living indistinguishable from the feignedfolk, as their choices are no longer their own but are shaped entirely by the will of the regime.

## The Banality of Evil
The concept of the [[banality of evil]] ([Eichmann in Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eichmann_in_Jerusalem)) is central to understanding the psychological and social mechanisms at play within the Chain of Delta. Ordinary individuals, through complicity and normalization, become agents of inhumanity and atrocity, as seen in the regime's structure and governance.

## Social Hierarchy and Control
### Photometal Implants and Citizenship
Citizenship in the Chain of Delta is marked by photometal implants, which suppress free speech and prevent the spread of the truth about Delta’s condition. These beads are upgraded to their strongest belief containment capability before a civilian is released to Estal Link, ensuring that dissent is minimized and control is maintained. The O-Cog, a type of photometal implant, becomes less noticeable over time and is most commonly found on the ventral side of the forearm.

### Social Mobility, Freedoms, and Legal System
Social mobility within the Chain of Delta is strictly regulated. Citizens earn their freedoms through a process of climbing through the Omep Regions: starting in Almalek (least freedoms, government and private labor only), then Rasm (privatized career specialization and state-aligned production goals), and finally Kleznit (military protection of infrastructure, resources, and ideology). Advancement is possible, but regression can occur from Kleznit to Rasm, never back to Almalek. In Delta's Omep Regions, it is legal to commit a crime so long as you are loyal to Fuscia's vision of the state. The government enables illegal activities to benefit from their effect on people, perpetuating the Klesn phylum belief that government is a cleansing, revitalizing force against evil.

### Hallid and Clol: The Novelli
Hallid (Yeast) and Clol (Mold) are Subcelia integrated into the governance of Delta, collectively known as the Novelli. These entities are instrumental in enforcing the state’s control, with Hallid spreading slow decay and Clol causing sudden destruction. Their opposing methods ensure that the population remains in a constant state of fear and dependency, unable to rise against Fuscia’s rule.

## Myth and Manipulation
### The Myth of Stallach
A significant aspect of the Chain of Delta’s control is the perpetuation of the Stallach myth. Stallach is a fabricated historical event used to spread misinformation and promote the leadership of Fuscia Lustin. The myth claims that Delta suffered economic chaos due to an open port, justifying strict control and restrictive policies. In reality, Stallach was a subtle coup, involving the assassination of a Triarch member and the installation of a Mimic general, consolidating Fuscia’s power.

### Keane and Propaganda
Keane are crow huma resonants evolved to serve as a force of misinformation under the guidance of Kee and her phylum Klesn. These crows work as journalists, artists, and propagandists, spreading the regime’s narrative and absorbing natural hatred. Keane are jingoistic, promoting the Chain Triarch and Fuscia as saviors, while misguiding the population away from the regime’s true intentions.

## Military and Security
### Military Districts
Delta’s military district is heavily fortified and serves as the only official exit from the capital order. Access is tightly controlled, and the district is designed to prevent dissent and maintain order. The military is a cornerstone of Delta’s security, with service seen as a path to economic stability and social elevation.

### Drug Use in Combat
Delta’s military is notorious for its reliance on drug use in combat, making its soldiers unpredictable and formidable. These drugs enhance endurance, aggression, and pain tolerance, giving Delta's military a significant edge. The chemically enhanced force is a key element of the regime’s control, and families often encourage enlistment for the benefits it brings.

### Death Marches
Death marches are a common tactic used on the plane’s Shelf to minimize the risk of dissent and prevent independence outside the chain. These brutal marches serve as a deterrent to rebellion and reinforce the regime’s dominance over its population.

## Economy and Living Conditions
### Economic Instability and Willed-Mecha Towns
Delta’s economy is highly unstable, with rapid price fluctuations for goods and services. Stores do not have fixed prices; instead, customers must check with Willed-Mecha Automata workers, who display current prices on screens embedded in their metallic frames. Willed-Mecha towns benefit from tourism and trade, operating under the control of the Chain of Delta but do not openly share their relation to the state. These towns are designed to attract huma and sell a false image of Wyldere, especially during harsh winters, as a result of the regime's propaganda. Sanctans generally avoid these towns, but many Wylderans are enticed by the false information propagated throughout the region. Willed-Mecha towns are a tool for the regime to shape perception and economic flow, while hiding their true connection to the state.

### Estal Link: Landing Strip
Estal Link is Delta’s facade of prosperity, a region that opens to foreign trade during specific times of the year. During these periods, Delta presents itself as a thriving city, hiding the corruption and suffering that fuel Estal’s wealth. The Omep regions outside Estal are only allowed to export goods into Estal, sustaining its market. After the trade period ends, Estal closes to outsiders, and Delta’s true conditions remain hidden.

## Social Engineering and Oppression
### Mold and Infrastructure Collapse
The Chain of Delta employs extensive social engineering to maintain its grip on power. The mold Clol is released through a complex sewer system, targeting specific areas at specific times. This causes infrastructure failures and societal collapse in targeted regions, forcing residents to seek refuge in more prosperous parts of the city. Access to these areas is tightly controlled, requiring government permission and the implantation of photometal beads, which suppress free speech and prevent the spread of the truth about Delta’s condition.

### Controlled Opposition
The regime uses controlled opposition to reinforce its legitimacy. The Triarch, ruling autocrats of the Omep regions, are complicit in clandestine government programs like MExtrema, which distributes drugs to foster addiction and control. Their feigned opposition bolsters Fuscia’s image as the only capable leader, while subtly flawed campaigns create a sense of dissent that is carefully managed and contained.

## Path to Freedom
### Almalek, Rasm, Kleznit Hierarchy
For a citizen of Delta to achieve the most freedom (short of escape), they must reach Estal Link. This is done by climbing through a hierarchy: starting in Almalek (least freedoms, government and private labor only), then Rasm (privatized career specialization and state-aligned production goals), and finally Kleznit (military protection of infrastructure, resources, and ideology). Advancement is possible, but regression can occur from Kleznit to Rasm, although never back to Almalek. The process breeds strong, capable individuals, but is designed to serve the state’s interests.

### Citizenship and Market Access
Citizenship is marked by photometal implants, which are upgraded before release to Estal Link. These implants grant access to the open market but suppress free speech. Only those who have climbed the hierarchy and passed government tests are permitted to enter Estal Link, where trade and relative prosperity are possible. The system ensures that only the most loyal and controlled citizens gain market access.

## Cultural and Magical Aspects
### Types of Magic and Propaganda
Delta has a higher concentration of magic users than any other major public-facing order, resulting in a society where magic is deeply woven into daily life and governance. This abundance of magic practitioners drives rapid development in fields such as artisanship, political maneuvering, and the leveraging of power. Artisanship magic enables individuals to achieve social mobility through skilled craft and innovation, while political and economic magics are used to accumulate influence, manipulate value, and maintain the regime’s control. The Chain of Delta’s magical culture fosters both advancement and competition, making it a center for magical progress and social transformation.

### Education and Social Taxonomy
Public education in Delta uses a hierarchical version of social taxonomy, justifying the actions of the state and society. This system spread through oral storytelling and those who fled, surviving even after the repeal of similar systems in other regions. The Chain of Delta created Social Taxonomy as a means to influence future generations and maintain control over societal information, especially during the Cel Blindbirth Line.

## Notable Locations and Outposts
### Sutresh, Indhost
[[Indhost]] is the largest cliff face of the [[Summons Mountain Range]] and a significant landmark within the northern territories claimed by the Chain of Delta. Beneath Indhost lies [[Sutresh]], a vast network of weeping caverns that serve as the hidden front of the Chain’s war against the vastless hordes of [[Decara]]. This conflict, kept entirely under wraps, is known only to the highest echelons of the regime and will later be remembered as the [[Second Endemic War]]. The Chain of Delta expends enormous resources and exploits its population to fulfill the military quotas necessary to resist the Decaran onslaught, all while maintaining secrecy from the wider world. Sutresh is riddled with battle stations and therium extraction facilities, built to fuel the regime’s war effort and resource acquisition. The caverns themselves are a symbol of the regime’s reach, the ongoing conflict, and the sacrifices demanded of its people to maintain power and resist the Decara’s attempts to reclaim the mother plane, [[Toma]], through [[Endem]].

#### War with Decara: The Second Endemic War
The war beneath Indhost, waged in the caverns of Sutresh, is a clandestine struggle that the Chain of Delta keeps hidden from its citizens and the outside world. Known in future histories as the [[Second Endemic War]], this conflict is marked by relentless battles against Decaran forces seeking to catalyze the revitalization of their kind by breaching into [[Endem]].

Unlike most wars, the Second Endemic War directly benefits the administrative drive to increase capita and resources for the regime. The people, unaware of the war’s existence, are nonetheless motivated by Fuscia Lustin’s cult of personality and the regime’s propaganda, which channels their labor and loyalty toward unseen military quotas. The war is not a unifying cause for the population, but rather a hidden engine for exploitation and resource extraction.

The Second Endemic War began not long after the [[First Endemic War]], which broke out into public view by accident. The failure to cover up the First War’s existence was a major factor in Fuscia Lustin’s rise to power prior to the [[Current Line]]. Learning from the mistakes of previous rulers, Fuscia initiated the Second Endemic War with a focus on secrecy and operational efficiency, determined to achieve therium extraction without risking the esteem of the people. To Fuscia, the failures of the past were not mere errors, but signs of weakness.

The First Endemic War only received its name after it became public knowledge, having started as a covert operation by the Chain before the casualty count spiked due to the increasing Decaran onslaught. The war ended with the defeat of the Decara by imploding one of the main Decaran tunnels into Endem, using baiting techniques and implosive weapons that risked military personnel for strategic gain.

Casualty ratios between the two wars highlight the regime’s growing efficiency: during the Second Endemic War, casualties are 3:1 in favor of the Chain, whereas by the end of the First War, casualties were 1:2 in favor of the Decarans. Fuscia’s political rise brought a dramatic increase in the effectiveness of therium extraction operations and military strategy, solidifying his control and the regime’s dominance in the hidden war beneath Sutresh.

### Isle of Kysilka
[[Kysilka]] is a military outpost located on an rocky isle in the South Vokari [[Mans Sea]]. It serves as a strategic point for the regime, reinforcing its control over strict port access, and extending their steady naval expansion. The Chain's military operations, such as this stronghold, further isolates the population from external influence.

### Propaganda and Comparative Messaging
The Chain of Delta propagates a positive message despite suffering, using state-controlled media and social engineering to maintain morale and loyalty. In contrast, Sol Unita propagates a healthy society and hides suffering, presenting a different model of governance and public messaging.

# Chain of Delta

_the Lasting Change, East Wind ([[Current Line]])_

  

The **Chain of Delta** is a dominant and authoritarian government power throughout [[Wyldere]], with its capital order, [[Delta]], located in the southern territory of [[Vokar]]. Led by the calculating and enigmatic [[Fuscia Lustin]] ([[Current Line]]) the regime maintains control through a combination of his personal leadership and the rule of [[Chain Triarch|autocrats]] who govern the three [[Omep region|Omep regions]] with an iron fist. The Chain enforces strict social hierarchy, uses photometal implants to suppress dissent, and relies on both military force and substance distribution to maintain order. Its influence shapes all of Wyldere, especially in Vokar, where the state's power is most deeply entrenched.

## Structure and Governance

### Capital Order: Delta

[[Delta]] is a technologically advanced yet deeply corrupt Order within the Toman Ecoss, ruled by the Chain. Delta prioritizes efficiency and productivity above all else, often at the cost of its citizens’ well-being. The state uses unique interkingdom practices, such as Natura enslavement to generate electricity, fueling rapid industrial growth. Or creating pollution pits with the aid of Celia, as well as other environmental hazards and natural disasters, as a means of controlling huma transportation. Governance is heavily militarized, especially within its three Omep Region sectors, each ruled by autocrats aligned with Fuscia Lustin. The poorest sector, Almalek, lies at the southwestern edge, bordering the Mans Sea floodplains to the south. The eastern sector is a militarized zone reserved for government and military operations, strictly controlled and requiring enhanced Photometal implants for entry. This sector also houses one of Delta’s two exits, a heavily guarded route only accessible with explicit government permission.

  

Rasm operates a tightly controlled society where citizens must apply for jobs through the government, which dictates their place of residence and social standing. The edge of the plane is used as an artificial border to conserve resources, with the poorest regions forced to live near this inhospitable boundary. Photometal implants are integral to this control, used extensively to track and monitor the population. These implants are taught as a religious rite of Klesn, symbolizing a ward against societal pollution, but in truth serve as tools for government surveillance, binding citizens to the state and suppressing dissent.

  

Estal Link is the affluent region of Delta, stretching from the port to the city center, where the Illid Munis is located. This area is the only part of Delta that engages in both import and export trade, with its market accessible only to those with citizenship in the Chain of Delta. During specific times of the year, Estal Link opens to global trade, presenting Delta as a prosperous and well-ordered city. In reality, the wealth of Estal Link is built on the suffering and exploitation of the Omep regions, which are closed off to outsiders.

  

A key aspect of Delta’s internal economy and social control is the secret operation known as MExtrema. Under this program, the government produces and distributes various drugs through third-party vendors, perceived as unaffiliated with the state. This operation controls the population by fostering addiction and identifies the most successful drug users in society, who are studied to replicate their traits in others, much like Fuscia Lustin has done with his own drug use.

  

Delta’s military is infamous for its use of drugs in combat, making its soldiers unpredictable and terrifying. The drugs administered enhance endurance, aggression, and pain tolerance, giving them a significant advantage. This chemically enhanced force is a cornerstone of Delta’s security, deterring threats and maintaining dominance in the region.

  

Beneath the surface, Delta is a society built on deception, control, and exploitation. The power grid, seen as a marvel of Fuscia Lustin's leadership, is actually a product of extreme cruelty towards natura. The leader's public persona as a champion of progress and innovation masks the horrific truth of how the city's power is maintained. Delta appears to thrive, but is rotting from within due to the corruption and moral decay of its leadership.

  

### Chain Triarch

The [[Chain Triarch]] is the ruling body composed of three autocrats, each governing one of the [[Omep Region]]s. While they appear to operate independently, they are closely aligned and communicate constantly to enforce the will of [[Fuscia Lustin]]. Each Triarch ruler is called an [[Arch]]. The Triarch’s structure is designed to maintain a firm grip on the population, with each region strategically positioned to reinforce the regime’s control. The Triarch also plays a key role in the perpetuation of myths and the orchestration of political events, such as the Stallach coup.

  

### The Role of the Medan

The [[Medan]] is the supreme leader of the Chain Triarch, responsible for overseeing the entire operation and ensuring the regime’s stability. The Medan secures domestic ties, manages the distribution of power among the Triarch, and acts as the central authority in Delta. This position is crucial for maintaining the clandestine government and orchestrating the manipulation of both the population and the Triarch members themselves. Medan translates to Archangel, signifying both spiritual and political authority.

  

### Omep Regions

The Omep Regions are three militarized districts outside of Estal Link, all within the territory of Delta. These regions are heavily controlled by autocrats loyal to Fuscia Lustin, each governing their respective sectors with an iron fist. The Omep Regions are a stark contrast to the wealth and prosperity of Estal Link, with the people living under constant surveillance, control, and fear. The government's use of Photometal to track and monitor the population ensures that no one can escape their grip.

  

#### Rasm

The northwestern and poorest region, bordered by the edge of the plane to the west and the Vok Wall to the north. Rasm is a harsh, desolate area where survival is a daily struggle. The people of Rasm live in extreme poverty, with little access to resources or opportunities. The government’s control over Rasm is absolute, with the region being heavily militarized to prevent any attempts at rebellion or escape. This is the production center of Delta.

  

#### Almalek

The second poorest region, located to the southwest of Estal Link and bordered by the ocean to the south. Almalek is ruled by Isaheim Maddows, a necromancer who uses a skeletal military force to maintain control. The people of Almalek live in fear of Isaheim and his undead soldiers, with many having resigned themselves to a life of oppression and despair. This region maintains agricultural and resource-harvesting requirements.

  

#### Kleznit

The northeastern Omep region, reserved for government and military operations. This area is strictly controlled, with access granted only to those with 3rd level Photometal implants. The Military District houses one of Delta’s two exits, a heavily guarded route that is only accessible with explicit government permission. This region serves as the nerve center of Delta’s military power, with its soldiers being heavily drugged and conditioned to obey orders without question.

  

### Chain Triarch

The [[Chain Triarch]] are the three [[Omep Region]] rulers, excluding [[Fuscia Lustin]]. Each Triarch ruler is called an [[Arch]]:

- [[Isaheim Maddows]] ([[Almalek]])

- [[Selman Oth]] ([[Rasm]])

- [[Aj'iru]] ([[Kleznit]])

  

#### Arch

An [[Arch]] is an Omep Region [[Chain Triarch]] leader within the Chain of Delta.

## The Banality of Evil

The concept of the [[banality of evil]] ([Eichmann in Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eichmann_in_Jerusalem)) is central to understanding the psychological and social mechanisms at play within the Chain of Delta. Ordinary individuals, through complicity and normalization, become agents of inhumanity and atrocity, as seen in the regime's structure and governance.

  

#### Almalek

Almalek is the Omep Region focused on extraction, agriculture, basic materials, storage, processing trade, and shipmaking. While shipmakers generally come from Rasm, they use blueprints designed in Almalek. The region is home to the largest amount of saltwater rivers in the Vokar Delta, with brackish water throughout most of Almalek except for the sea touching the Mans Sea. Almalek's Delta hosts forced labor camps, primarily for agriculture and basic materials. The region contains dangerous wilderness sections, including river beasts, ogres, Monstra, and enraged natura, which society finds ways to avoid. Delta claims this territory and uses the dangers within the region to better control and motivate society. This is similar to the use of the Novelli within urban zones of Almalek and Rasm, as well as for an upward flow of information and surveillance for Kleznit and ultimately Fuscia.

  

## Social Hierarchy and Control

### Photometal Implants and Citizenship

Citizenship in the Chain of Delta is marked by photometal implants, which suppress free speech and prevent the spread of the truth about Delta’s condition. These beads are upgraded to their strongest belief containment capability before a civilian is released to Estal Link, ensuring that dissent is minimized and control is maintained. The O-Cog, a type of photometal implant, becomes less noticeable over time and is most commonly found on the ventral side of the forearm.

  

### Social Mobility, Freedoms, and Legal System

Social mobility within the Chain of Delta is strictly regulated. Citizens earn their freedoms through a process of climbing through the Omep Regions: starting in Almalek (least freedoms, government and private labor only), then Rasm (privatized career specialization and state-aligned production goals), and finally Kleznit (military protection of infrastructure, resources, and ideology). Advancement is possible, but regression can occur from Kleznit to Rasm, never back to Almalek. In Delta's Omep Regions, it is legal to commit a crime so long as you are loyal to Fuscia's vision of the state. The government enables illegal activities to benefit from their effect on people, perpetuating the Klesn phylum belief that government is a cleansing, revitalizing force against evil.

  

### Hallid and Clol: The Novelli

Hallid (Yeast) and Clol (Mold) are Subcelia integrated into the governance of Delta, collectively known as the Novelli. These entities are instrumental in enforcing the state’s control, with Hallid spreading slow decay and Clol causing sudden destruction. Their opposing methods ensure that the population remains in a constant state of fear and dependency, unable to rise against Fuscia’s rule.

  

## Myth and Manipulation

### The Myth of Stallach

A significant aspect of the Chain of Delta’s control is the perpetuation of the Stallach myth. Stallach is a fabricated historical event used to spread misinformation and promote the leadership of Fuscia Lustin. The myth claims that Delta suffered economic chaos due to an open port, justifying strict control and restrictive policies. In reality, Stallach was a subtle coup, involving the assassination of a Triarch member and the installation of a Mimic general, consolidating Fuscia’s power.

  

### Keane and Propaganda

Keane are crow huma resonants evolved to serve as a force of misinformation under the guidance of Kee and her phylum Klesn. These crows work as journalists, artists, and propagandists, spreading the regime’s narrative and absorbing natural hatred. Keane are jingoistic, promoting the Chain Triarch and Fuscia as saviors, while misguiding the population away from the regime’s true intentions.

  

## Military and Security

### Military Districts

Delta’s military district is heavily fortified and serves as the only official exit from the capital order. Access is tightly controlled, and the district is designed to prevent dissent and maintain order. The military is a cornerstone of Delta’s security, with service seen as a path to economic stability and social elevation.

  

### Drug Use in Combat

Delta’s military is notorious for its reliance on drug use in combat, making its soldiers unpredictable and formidable. These drugs enhance endurance, aggression, and pain tolerance, giving Delta's military a significant edge. The chemically enhanced force is a key element of the regime’s control, and families often encourage enlistment for the benefits it brings.

  

### Death Marches

Death marches are a common tactic used en route to the plane’s Shelf to minimize dissent and prevent liberation attempts. These brutal marches serve as a deterrent to rebellion and reinforce the regime’s dominance over its population.

  

## Economy and Living Conditions

### Economic Instability and Willed-Mecha Towns

Delta’s economy is highly unstable, with rapid price fluctuations for goods and services. Stores do not have fixed prices; instead, customers must check with Willed-Mecha Automata workers, who display current prices on screens embedded in their metallic frames. Willed-Mecha towns benefit from tourism and trade, operating under the control of the Chain of Delta but do not openly share their relation to the state. These towns are designed to attract huma and sell a false image of Wyldere, especially during harsh winters, as a result of the regime's propaganda. Sanctans generally avoid these towns, but many Wylderans are enticed by the false information propagated throughout the region. Willed-Mecha towns are a tool for the regime to shape perception and economic flow, while hiding their true connection to the state.

  

### Estal Link: Landing Strip

Estal Link is Delta’s facade of prosperity, a region that opens to foreign trade during specific times of the year. During these periods, Delta presents itself as a thriving city, hiding the corruption and suffering that fuel Estal’s wealth. The Omep regions outside Estal are only allowed to export goods into Estal, sustaining its market. After the trade period ends, Estal closes to outsiders, and Delta’s true conditions remain hidden.

  

## Social Engineering and Oppression

### Mold and Infrastructure Collapse

The Chain of Delta employs extensive social engineering to maintain its grip on power. The mold Clol is released through a complex sewer system, targeting specific areas at specific times. This causes infrastructure failures and societal collapse in targeted regions, forcing residents to seek refuge in more prosperous parts of the city. Access to these areas is tightly controlled, requiring government permission and the implantation of photometal beads, which suppress free speech and prevent the spread of the truth about Delta’s condition.

  

### Controlled Opposition

The regime uses controlled opposition to reinforce its legitimacy. The Triarch, ruling autocrats of the Omep regions, are complicit in clandestine government programs like MExtrema, which distributes drugs to foster addiction and control. Their feigned opposition bolsters Fuscia’s image as the only capable leader, while subtly flawed campaigns create a sense of dissent that is carefully managed and contained.

  

## Path to Freedom

### Almalek, Rasm, Kleznit Hierarchy

For a citizen of Delta to achieve the most freedom (short of escape), they must reach Estal Link. This is done by climbing through a hierarchy: starting in Almalek (least freedoms, government and private labor only), then Rasm (privatized career specialization and state-aligned production goals), and finally Kleznit (military protection of infrastructure, resources, and ideology). Advancement is possible, but regression can occur from Kleznit to Rasm, although never back to Almalek. The process breeds strong, capable individuals, but is designed to serve the state’s interests.

  

### Citizenship and Market Access

Citizenship is marked by photometal implants, which are upgraded before release to Estal Link. These implants grant access to the open market but suppress free speech. Only those who have climbed the hierarchy and passed government tests are permitted to enter Estal Link, where trade and relative prosperity are possible. The system ensures that only the most loyal and controlled citizens gain market access.

  

## Cultural and Magical Aspects

### Types of Magic and Propaganda

Delta has a higher concentration of magic users than any other major public-facing order, resulting in a society where magic is deeply woven into daily life and governance. This abundance of magic practitioners drives rapid development in fields such as artisanship, political maneuvering, and the leveraging of power. Artisanship magic enables individuals to achieve social mobility through skilled craft and innovation, while political and economic magics are used to accumulate influence, manipulate value, and maintain the regime’s control. The Chain of Delta’s magical culture fosters both advancement and competition, making it a center for magical progress and social transformation.

  

### Education and Social Taxonomy

Public education in Delta uses a hierarchical version of social taxonomy, justifying the actions of the state and society. This system spread through oral storytelling and those who fled, surviving even after the repeal of similar systems in other regions. The Chain of Delta created Social Taxonomy as a means to influence future generations and maintain control over societal information, especially during the Cel Blindbirth Line.

  

## Notable Locations and Outposts

### S'thresh, Indhost

[[Indhost]] is the largest cliff face of the [[Summons Mountain Range]] and a significant landmark within the northern territories claimed by the Chain of Delta. Beneath Indhost lies [[S'thresh]], a vast network of weeping caverns that serve as the hidden front of the Chain’s war against the vastless hordes of [[Decara]]. This conflict, kept entirely under wraps, is known only to the highest echelons of the regime and will later be remembered as the [[Second Endemic War]]. The Chain of Delta expends enormous resources and exploits its population to fulfill the military quotas necessary to resist the Decaran onslaught, all while maintaining secrecy from the wider world. S'thresh is riddled with battle stations and therium extraction facilities, built to fuel the regime’s war effort and resource acquisition. The caverns themselves are a symbol of the regime’s reach, the ongoing conflict, and the sacrifices demanded of its people to maintain power and resist the Decara’s attempts to reclaim the mother plane, [[Toma]], through [[Endem]].

  

#### War with Decara: The Second Endemic War

The war beneath Indhost, waged in the caverns of S'thresh, is a clandestine struggle that the Chain of Delta keeps hidden from its citizens and the outside world. Known in future histories as the [[Second Endemic War]], this conflict is marked by relentless battles against Decaran forces seeking to catalyze the revitalization of their kind by breaching into [[Endem]].

  

Unlike most wars, the Second Endemic War directly benefits the administrative drive to increase capita and resources for the regime. The people, unaware of the war’s existence, are nonetheless motivated by Fuscia Lustin’s cult of personality and the regime’s propaganda, which channels their labor and loyalty toward unseen military quotas. The war is not a unifying cause for the population, but rather a hidden engine for exploitation and resource extraction.

  

The Second Endemic War began not long after the [[First Endemic War]], which broke out into public view by accident. The failure to cover up the First War’s existence was a major factor in Fuscia Lustin’s rise to power prior to the [[Current Line]]. Learning from the mistakes of previous rulers, Fuscia initiated the Second Endemic War with a focus on secrecy and operational efficiency, determined to achieve therium extraction without risking the esteem of the people. To Fuscia, the failures of the past were not mere errors, but signs of weakness.

  

The First Endemic War only received its name after it became public knowledge, having started as a covert operation by the Chain before the casualty count spiked due to the increasing Decaran onslaught. The war ended with the defeat of the Decara by imploding one of the main Decaran tunnels into Endem, using baiting techniques and implosive weapons that risked military personnel for strategic gain.

  

Casualty ratios between the two wars highlight the regime’s growing efficiency: during the Second Endemic War, casualties are 3:1 in favor of the Chain, whereas by the end of the First War, casualties were 1:2 in favor of the Decarans. Fuscia’s political rise brought a dramatic increase in the effectiveness of therium extraction operations and military strategy, solidifying his control and the regime’s dominance in the hidden war beneath S'thresh.

  

### Isle of Kysilka

[[Kysilka]] is a military outpost located on an rocky isle in the South Vokari [[Mans Sea]]. It serves as a strategic point for the regime, reinforcing its control over strict port access, and extending their steady naval expansion. The Chain's military operations, such as this stronghold, further isolates the population from external influence.

  

### Propaganda and Comparative Messaging

The Chain of Delta propagates a positive message despite suffering, using state-controlled media and social engineering to maintain morale and loyalty. In contrast, Sol Unita propagates a healthy society and hides suffering, presenting a different model of governance and public messaging.

  The idea and symbolism of the Chain is based on the idea of a strict interkingdom social  relationship system meant to guide society into incredible and constant growth without shattering or decaying into multiple Vokari societies. The Chain has remained intact since the Cel Blindbirth Line.
  
Huma receive primacy in the Chain. All else serves huma in their goals. Huma and Monstra are not distinguished in the same way that outside cultures do. It is a cultural norm to either not know, or not believe, in the existence of a Monstra kingdom. Monstra are Huma in the eyes of Deltans.

The kingdoms below serve in a chain of influence within Delta.
Decara -> Natura -> Bluma -> Ferra -> Celia -> Huma

Decara influences minerals

Gorisains strength has grown so powerful that he is assuming the roles of the Natura Kingdom in his consumption in Dar, which feasts on Endem and Toma. It is said amongst the Triarch that long ago there was a plane below Endem but it was consumed by Dar. It is unknown if this is true or not but it is an interesting conspiracy.

Decara exists in the chain, but it actually exists before Natura, as the first kingdom. However, in the official publicized view of the Chain, Decara is not shown in it. 

Decara being the first kingdom influences the approach that has been placed upon society, specifically with the idea of dealing with one’s suffering and evil. This relates to the philosophical idea that evil is within us as mediocrity and we must escape from it by continuously changing. It is a patriarchal design with the perpetuation of a matriarchy.

Decara’s position in the Chain is pivotal to the story of Gorisain and how his influence and power have dramatically increased since his formation of Dar. The Chain’s knowledge of the existence of Dar is the reason for their belief that Decara comes before Natura, as they understand that Decara, in strange and gruesome ways, influence the grounds beneath them. This has been studied since the Taxotheir Line. A decaran outbreak was the reason for the line ending, due to such a high death rate causing the gyre shift to occur.

  Automata are the backdrop kingdom, or the ever present kingdom of the Chain, meaning they are a part of every other kingdom in the chain. Automata are mimics of life and therefore are thought of as the chain’s casing.



No food ever goes to waste in Delta. Huma eating Huma in Almalek is permissible, but in Rasm and beyond it is looked down upon. Other creatures eating Huma is not permissible, but is also only enforced crudely, making it more of a cultural expectation. However, as a huma goes rises through social mobility, the enforcement of this rule increases dramatically. It is not considered the state’s right to

Highly individualistic society where every person has to have their own niche to survive, however, collectively they are united under Fuscia’s inspirational leadership. Denire’s see Fuscia as their perfect leader, whereas Knoire’s see him as the bar, or the role model, for the Chain’s guidance. Knoire’s understand history whereas Denire’s believe Fuscia is history. Knoire’s see Fuscia as the greatest but not as great for eternity. Being Medan is the most competitive role in the Chain, but only for those that realize they are competing for it, Denires are the fuel for this competition.

To the Denire, everything that is good happens because of Fuscia’s leadership. Despite his role, everything that is bad is believed to happen because of the bureaucracy in place rather than his doing.
