The **Chain of Delta** is a powerful and enigmatic [[Class]] within the [[Toman Ecoss]], ruled by **[[Fuscia Lustin]]**. This totalitarian regime maintains absolute control over the [[Order]] of **[[Delta]]** and its [[Omep Region]]s, where every aspect of life is influenced by Fuscia's cunning manipulation, societal engineering, and the use of various substance distribution to maintain order. The Chain of Delta has also integrated large portions of the [[Celia]] Kingdom, particularly the Subcelia **[[Hallid]]** and **[[Clol]]**, into its governance, using them to spread hysteria and violence to maintain control over the populace.

### Structure and Governance

Delta operates under a unique governance structure known as the **[[Chain Triarch]]**, where three regions function independently in the public eye but are in constant communication with one another. The leader of the Triarch, known as the **[[Medan]]**, oversees the entire operation, with **[[Illid Munis]]** acting as the centroid of this triangular formation. The Medan, as the leader, is responsible for securing domestic ties and ensuring that the state's control remains unchallenged.

The Chain of Delta uses this triangular composition of local governments to maintain a firm grip over its citizens. The three regions are not just administrative divisions but are strategically positioned to enforce Fuscia's rule. The Omep regions, particularly, are isolated and heavily controlled, with the military district serving as the only official exit from Delta. This exit is only accessible through granted permission, reinforcing the isolation and control exerted over the population.

### The Myth of Stallach

A significant aspect of the Chain of Delta’s control is the perpetuation of the **[[Stallach]]** myth. Stallach is a fabricated historical event used to spread misinformation and promote the leadership of Fuscia Lustin. According to the myth, Stallach was a time when Delta could not properly manage an influx of foreign trade due to an open port, leading to economic chaos and the manipulation of citizenship laws. This narrative serves to justify Fuscia's strict control and the restrictive policies of the state.

However, the true events of Stallach are far more sinister. It was, in fact, a subtle coup designed to overthrow the previous government through a manipulated election. Two of the three Triarch members plotted the assassination of the third Arch, who ruled over the Omep region that has now been transformed into a militarized zone. This leader was replaced with a [[Mimic]] general from **[[Isaheim Maddows]]**’ military, solidifying the power of Fuscia Lustin and his allies. Fuscia ran on a platform that decried the corrupting influence within the Chain of Delta, but this was all part of the orchestration to place him in power, aligning the three Omep leaders under one clandestine government, hidden from the public eye.

### MExtrema: Social Panacea

At the heart of Fuscia's control lies **[[MExtrema]]**, a clandestine government program that produces and distributes a wide variety of drugs through seemingly unaffiliated third-party vendors within Delta. This operation serves multiple purposes: fostering addiction to control the population, and identifying individuals who thrive under heavy drug use. These individuals are studied, with the goal of replicating Fuscia’s own ability to manipulate and thrive under substances.

MExtrema is the subject of many conspiracy theories, particularly among dissenters who view it as a key element of the government's deep-seated corruption. The Triarch, the ruling autocrats of the Omep regions, are complicit in MExtrema, using their feigned opposition to bolster Fuscia’s image as the only capable leader. Through subtly flawed campaigns, they create a controlled opposition, reinforcing the legitimacy of Fuscia’s rule.

### Military Power and Drug Use

Delta’s military is notorious for its reliance on drug use in combat, making its soldiers unpredictable and formidable. These drugs enhance endurance, aggression, and pain tolerance, giving Delta's military a significant edge. This chemically enhanced force is a cornerstone of Delta’s security, with military service seen as a path to economic stability and social elevation. Families often encourage their children to enlist, knowing that military service brings significant benefits, including financial support for their loved ones.

### Economic System and Social Conditions

Delta's economy is highly unstable, with rapid price fluctuations for goods and services. Stores do not have fixed prices; instead, customers must check with **[[Willed-Mecha]]** [[Automata]] workers, who display the current prices on screens embedded in their metallic frames. These Willed-Mecha constructs, designed with a style reminiscent of archaic computing systems, are integral to commerce in Delta, reflecting the society's chaotic economic conditions.

The standard of living varies greatly, with most of the population living in poor conditions, particularly in the Omep regions. The richest area, known as **[[Estal Link]]**, stretches from the port to the city center and is the only region that can engage in both import and export trade. Citizenship in the Chain of Delta is marked by **[[Photometal]]** implants, which not only grant access to Estal Link's open market but also suppress free speech, ensuring that citizens cannot reveal the true nature of Delta to outsiders.

### Estal Link: Landing Strip

Estal Link is Delta's facade of prosperity, a region that opens to foreign trade during specific times of the year, as dictated by Fuscia and the Triarch. During these trade periods, Delta presents itself as a thriving, well-ordered city, carefully hiding the corruption and suffering that fuel Estal’s wealth. The Omep regions outside Estal are only allowed to export goods into Estal, sustaining its market. After the trade period ends, Estal closes to outsiders, and Delta's true conditions—marked by exploitation and oppression—remain hidden from the world.

### Social Engineering and Control

The Chain of Delta employs extensive social engineering to maintain its grip on power. The mold **[[Clol]]**, used to control and disrupt the population, is released through a complex sewer system designed to target specific areas at specific times. This mold causes infrastructure failures and societal collapse in targeted regions, forcing residents to seek refuge in more prosperous parts of the city. Access to these areas is tightly controlled, requiring government permission obtained through a rigorous process that includes a test and the implantation of photometal beads in the arms. These beads suppress free speech and prevent the spread of the truth about Delta’s condition.

### Hallid and Clol: Forces of Oppression

Within the Chain of Delta, the Subcelia **[[Hallid]]** (Yeast) and **[[Clol]]** (Mold) are pivotal to maintaining control over the Order. Collectively known as the **NV** or **[[Novelli]]** by the common people of Delta, these Subcelia are instrumental in enforcing the state’s control. While both are devoted to Fuscia, they have opposing views on how to conduct suffering within Delta. **Hallid** focuses on a slow, creeping form of decay, spreading its influence gradually to create a pervasive sense of dread and inevitability. **Clol**, in contrast, believes in sudden, overwhelming acts of destruction, using its mold to create chaos and fear in a more immediate, violent manner. Together, these opposing forces ensure that the citizens of Delta remain in a constant state of fear and dependency, unable to rise against Fuscia’s rule.

### The Slow Path to Perfection

Delta’s progress is deliberately slow, a calculated strategy by Fuscia and the **[[Chain Triarch]]** to maximize the benefits of their citizens' pain without risking the stability of their rule. Progress is made at a pace that allows the government to exploit the population’s suffering for as long as possible. This slow, greedy approach to governance is intended to create a perfect society, but only on the terms dictated by those in power. The benefits of progress are reaped by the elite, while the masses remain in a state of controlled dependency.

### The Role of the Klesn Phylum

The **[[Klesn]]** phylum, to which the Chain of Delta belongs, promotes the cleansing of society’s “natural evils.” Within this belief system, drugs are not seen as an evil but as a necessary means of escape from the greater evils of society. **[[Drooga]]**, a sub-kingdom of **[[Automata]]** within the Klesn phylum, consists of drug-related constructs that facilitate this escape. The Chain of Delta's ideology is deeply intertwined with the principles of Klesn, justifying the regime's harsh measures as necessary for the greater good.

### The Triarch and the Omep Regions

The Chain of Delta is divided into three [[Omep Region]], each ruled by an autocrat known as the [[Chain Triarch]]. These regions are isolated from Estal Link and are subject to strict government control. The Triarch, who are partners of Fuscia, oversee the implementation of government policies, ensuring that the Omep regions remain subservient to the central authority. The Omep regions, particularly the military district in the east, are heavily fortified and monitored, with access tightly controlled through the use of enhanced photometal beads.

These regions are designed to keep the population in check, with the military district serving as the only official exit from Delta. The Omep regions are where the harshest conditions prevail, with the poorest areas being Rasm in the north and Almalek in the west. The Triarch's role is to maintain order in these regions, using fear, control, and exploitation to ensure that the government’s grip on power remains unchallenged.












For a citizen of Delta to achieve the most amount of freedom (except completely escaping) they must reach Estal Link. This is done when a civilian climbs through a hierarchy starting with [[Almalek]] , then [[Rasm]], then [[Kleznit]]. Once you have served and climbed through all three, you are considered for Estal Link. It is possible to regress back into Rasm from Kleznit, but never will someone return to Almalek once they have escaped.

The name for the Chain of Delta comes from the symbolic idea that the people of Vokar will remain in this land always, as if they were chained down to it by force. This is why from the Illid Munis there are chains reaching towards the three Omep Regions of Delta. These people are battle-hardened and forced to adapt both physically and mentally over time in strange ways, using suffering as a means of climbing to the top of the global food chain. 

Citizens under the Chain of Delta earn their freedoms through the process of climbing through the Omep Regions, in hopes of making it to Estal Link. Almalek is the first region and has the least amount of freedoms. Huma work entirely for the government with no option of specialization in any sense. The only freedom is that of association, causing people to build upon this idea of finding the right group to move you into the next region. The next region of Rasm allows a deeper specialization of career and association, transitioning from consumption-based economy in Almalek to production in Rasm. Then from Rasm to Kleznit, the economy is focused on protection of infrastructure and resources. These resources get funneled into society as fuel. The entire process breeds incredible Huma, some of the smartest, funniest, strongest, and generally most powerful and capable people.

There is no free speech or mind within the Chain of Delta due to Photometal bead implants, however certain things are not impeded by the beads. Cooperation or association is one of them. 

PTSD and other mental health issues are often overlooked, but are incredibly common. Coping mechanisms tend to be very extreme in Deltan people, even after they have made it into Estal Link. This is one of few insights into the entire process, as it is kept under wraps by the government, especially when Delta's market is open.













Death marches are a common tactic used on the plane's [[Shelf]] to minimalize the risk of dissent and the seeking of independence outside the chain.


[[Keane]] are the name for both Zothros and Anthros crow huma resonants that were purposefully evolved to serve as a force of misinformation under the guidance of [[Kee]] and her phylum [[Klesn]]. These crows are seen as truthful by many individuals that believe in the Chain of Delta false advertisements and operations, which pretend to value the lives of the people but really only value the protection of the state and its current power structure. These crow people may work as journalists, graphic artists, or whatever other occupations spreading political propaganda sided with the Chain of Delta's three Omep regions (Each ruled by one of three Archs) or Kee's religious influence. Keane are jingoistic, whereas most inhabitants side with Fuscia, as he is seen as the savior of the common people. Of course, this is not true. This is what Fuscia wants the people to believe so that he is continuously elected and slowly gauges his people with the help of Kee, her Keane, the [[Chain Triarch]], and all the misguided citizens of Delta's regions. The Keane serve as an absorption of natural hatred, in order to misguide the people away from ever revealing the fact that Fuscia could be the orchestrator of the Chain's entire power scheme.

The Chain Triarch serve as scapegoats for Fuscia's public influence, but still benefit from the power scheme immensely, especially when isolated from the people they rule.

Kee has mixed influence over the people, due to her relation to the Keane. Her and the Keane promote self growth through facing hardship head on, which is valuable, however the Keane's public image of promoting the Chain Triarch as well limits the effectiveness of her influence, and instead routes it to Fuscia. Facing hardship head on is a belief of Klesn, due to the societal pollution that the Chain places on its own people to strengthen them and kill off the weak.

From the perspective of the common people, Fuscia is seen as a hero and the only reason why things get better. He is hope. 

An [[Okog]] is a name for these photometal implants. An O-Cog, over the course of a creature's life becomes less and less noticeable. An O-Cog is most commonly found on the ventral side of the forearm, but can exist in other places depending on the creature.



Chain of Delta public education uses a hierarchal version of social taxonomy, which justifies the actions of their society and state. Scender's version of this is not nearly as hierarchal and has slowly been repealed. Social taxonomy either spread from those who fled or through oral storytelling that managed to survive the [[Cel Blindbirth Line]].








Chain of Delta has unique types of magic present, 
Economic Magic - Focused on influencing value. Resource Magic, Therium Magic
Industrial Magic - Focused on influencing production. Water, Electricity, Pressure, Oil, Fuel, automation, automata, etc.
Political Magic - Backstabbing, accumulating influence, propaganda, power.

Spell idea, 
"You summon 15 sheets of paper, distributed rather evenly, within a mile radius. These papers can be found attached to tavern doors, trees, quest boards, and other similar locations. Each paper contain the exact same information decided by the caster.. Choose up to 25 words to put on this page. This may include up to a single image or drawing, as well as other design explanations if necessary and allowed by the DM."

Upcasting this spell increases the amount of sheets of paper by 15 and the radius by 1 mile."












Chain of Delta military execution line. Essentially, when an army progresses, there is a series of spellsnipers and militants who kill anyone who seems to be defecting on the (often open snow) battlefield.


Chain of Delta requires sheer strength to survive which makes people from this region very mean to each other, willing to do what it takes for oneself and the state to survive. 





Automata in Delta come by the many, as a collective uprising against the regime, whereas in Scender it is one individual automata named Viv who destroys the collective. Delta has an authoritarian right regime and Scender has a religious, yet libertarian left regime within the bounds of their religion.




It is illegal to do drugs on the continent of Wyldere (according to the Chain’s national law). 



[[Kysilka]] as a name for a military outpost outside of Delta in the sea.

The Chain of Delta created Social Taxonomy. While all Huma societies were underground, Delta planted archeological sites to influence the next generation of huma societal information This occurred during the Cel Blindbirth Line as a massive project to revitalize society through the sabotage of future nations which would compete with Delta following the dark ages caused by [[Alwa]]'s rise to power.
