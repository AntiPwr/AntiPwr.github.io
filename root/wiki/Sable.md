## Geography and Environment

### Southern Sable: Fjords and Cliffs
Sable’s southern coast is reminiscent of a Nordic fjord, with ocean inlets cutting deep into the land. Towering cliffs rise sharply from the sea, forming a coastline of treacherous rock walls, dark evergreen forests, and narrow plains atop the bluffs. The climate is cool and maritime, with near-constant winds and frequent misty rain. Hardy spruce and pine trees cling to the cliff edges, and waterfalls plunge into turquoise fjord waters below. Fertile terraces support hardy crops, and wildlife such as mountain goats and seabirds thrive in the crags.

### Northern Sable (Sabelis): Tundra and Autumnal Woods
As one travels north, the environment shifts toward windswept tundra and enchanted autumnal woods. Sabelis, the northern part of Sable, borders the Summons Mountain Range and endures a harsher climate. The tundra is a flat, glacial plateau with wildflowers in summer and a landscape of red and gold in autumn. Hardy birch and larch trees line sheltered valleys, and the coast offers dramatic vistas of golden woods above icy seas.

### The Summons Mountain Range
The Summons Range forms Sable’s northern horizon: jagged, snow-capped peaks forged by tectonic forces. The lower slopes are treacherous scree and glaciers, and avalanches are common. The air is thin and brutally cold, and only the hardiest plants survive in cracks of frost-shattered rock. Locals avoid venturing too far north, as the mountains become deadly and impassable.

## Climate and Seasons
Sable’s climate is defined by sharp contrasts: mild, misty summers in the south, and long, brutal winters in the north. The region is known for its fiery autumn forests and the bleak, wind-scoured tundra of Sabelis. Snow and blizzards are common in winter, and the wind can be fierce year-round.

## Culture and Settlement
Sable’s people are shaped by the land’s challenges. Settlements cling to the more fertile terraces and valleys, relying on hardy crops and resourcefulness. The region’s isolation and dramatic environment foster a culture of resilience, myth, and reverence for the wild. Sable is also known for its mineral wealth and the mystical qualities of its forests and mountains.

Sable means to be albino, but instead of white and red it is black and purple.
