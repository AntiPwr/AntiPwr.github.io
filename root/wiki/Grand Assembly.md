# Grand Assembly

*Grand Assembly* is a [[Social Arts|Social Art]] dedicated to assembling balance from unbalanced constituents. Through the use of circular matrices—each representing key domains such as Economics, Culture, or Ideology—this study helps reveal both macrocosmic and microcosmic imbalances between groups.

In our system, each domain is visualized as a circle whose size reflects its weight (both objective and perceived) and whose segmentation shows the relative influence of two groups. The system also aims to overcome challenges like **Half-Court Tennis**, where a narrow perspective prevents genuine understanding of another side’s views.

Below you can experiment with the simulation tool for the Grand Assembly. The simulation allows you to update domain data, and as new data enters, it aggregates into a dynamic overview that reflects the shifting balance between groups. This interactivity is designed as a “game” that rewards understanding both sides to help find pathways toward relimination (restoring balance).


## Guidelines for Assessing Domains

- **Weight Assignment and Perceived Importance:**  
  Each domain is given a weight (1–100) based on quantitative and qualitative impact. For instance, in economic domains, you might consider GDP, trade balances, and employment rates, while cultural domains might evaluate language unity, traditions, and historical narratives. The circle’s size reflects this weight.

- **Subjectivity Mitigation:**  
  Standardize criteria through empirical data, expert surveys, and cross-referenced qualitative studies. Include a “mirror-check” to ensure evaluations incorporate both groups’ perspectives and hold calibration sessions among experts.

- **Perspective Integration:**  
  Recognize that genuine balance requires understanding the opposing side. For example, in analyzing Indo-Pakistani relations, acknowledge the shared colonial legacy alongside differing narratives. This understanding is rewarded within the system and guides the path to relimination.

- **Dynamic Data and System Fluidity:**  
  The Grand Assembly is designed to be dynamic. As new data is fed into the system, individual domain matrices update, cascading changes upward into the overall assembly. Future AI integration can further automate this process, tracking temporal shifts and refining the grand liminant (the decisive driver of imbalance).
