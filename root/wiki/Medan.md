## Etymology and Symbolism

"Medan" means "Archangel," reflecting the leader's role as both . The Medan is seen as the embodiment of Delta's purpose, often associated with divine or supernatural qualities.

## Role in Delta

The Medan oversees all major decisions, controls the [[Omep Region]]s, and maintains the balance of power among the Triarchs (each called an [[Arch]]). The Medan's authority is absolute, and their actions shape the fate of Delta and its people.
The position of Medan is lifelong—there can only ever be one Medan alive at a time. When a new Medan is chosen, the previous Medan must die, either by tradition, ritual, or circumstance. No Medan has ever lost power and remained alive.

## Notable Medan

- [[Fuscia Lustin]] (IV: current)
- [[]] (III: )
- [[]] (II: )
- [[]] (I: )

## The Medan Line and Democratic Function

Throughout history, the numbering of Medans is strictly limited. There are only ever a maximum of four Medans allowed to be known in recorded history, including the current Medan. At the end of each line, the people of Delta hold a vote—the only true and significant democratic function of the Chain of Delta—to determine which rulers were the most impactful. This poll is treated with the utmost respect and has never been cheated by Deltans.

In total, this creates seven named religious and political figures: the three Archs under the Medan, the current Medan, and the three Medans before. From the people's perspective, these important figures are presented to them, controlled behind the scenes, and used to guide future planning. When the line ends, the three Archs are chosen, as well as the new leader.

Political elections for the Chain of Delta do not occur on scheduled days. Instead, the people's desire to rule or use someone as tribute can trigger an election. Elections are entirely crowdfunded and prepared by the people. If the vote exceeds the prior election's desire from the people, then a regime change is due. This process, at times, has been somewhat anarchic, but has also forced the people into unity, as seen with Fuscia's political rise.

_Grand Signifier_

A **Medan** is a leader of the [[Chain of Delta]]. The current Medan is [[Fuscia Lustin]].


A Medan's role is as a mediator for the Chain Triarch, meant to promote growth by aiding the separate needs of the Omep regions. This position does not have that much power (in the public eye), hence the reason why Fuscia can get away with his lack of positive change for the people. In the public eye, he is constantly trying to promote good change by fighting the evil intentions of the Chain Triarch, but really he is orchestrating this idea and gouging his own people for his benefit. At the same time he is producing the best and most capable Huma, without care for how they may feel about it.
