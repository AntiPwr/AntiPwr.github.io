# Snoller
_Bullsnail_

**Eco:** [[Toma]] ([[Sancta]], [[Jeti Sound]]) of [[Toman Ecoss]] 
**Kingdom:** [[Ferra]] (**Sound Snoller**)

The **Snoller** is a species of coastal snail native to the [[Jeti Sound]] region of [[Sancta]]. This unique subkingdom of Ferra can thrive both in the ocean and on land, displaying remarkable adaptability. Snallers are integral to Scender's transportation system, where they are used as a living elevator system, moving people and goods up and down the steep inclines of the city due to their abnormally large size and sticky slime residue.

### Biological Characteristics

- _Diet_: Snallers primarily consume the [[Pomtum]], a blue, juicy, tomato-like berry that grows in the tropical coastal areas. The Pomtum fruit has a unique effect on the Snaller, subtly altering the hue of their shells, which plays a significant role in their mating rituals. Snallers that consume more Pomtum are more likely to attract mates, leading to a natural selection of snails that are both faster and more vibrant in color.

- _Speed_: Unlike typical snails, Snallers are relatively fast, a trait developed due to the need to quickly reach Pomtum plants, which grow in tropical shrubs, separate from their shallow water coastal breeding grounds. This speed makes them viable for use in Scender’s transportation system, where they climb walls and steep inclines with the aid of ropes, providing an eco-friendly and efficient elevator system.


### Role in Scender

In Scender, Snallers are found in specific areas known as alcoves, which are parts of the city's ripple structure with strict 90-degree vertical turns. These snails are attracted to plants that are purposefully planted in these alcoves, and their ability to traverse walls makes them an ideal solution for the city’s unique topography.
