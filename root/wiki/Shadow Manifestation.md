While one's Will Pool is comprised of Shadow, the interplay between light and one's body is treacherous. Exposure to any light immediately converts the shadow-touched portion of the Will into soul-damaging energy, highlighting the delicate—and dangerous—balance between empowerment and self-destruction inherent in this dark magic. This damage cannot be resisted and one's will is immediately replaced after taking damage.

### Light Exposure:
When a player's Will has been tainted by the influence of shadow (i.e., when part of it is transformed into Shade Will), exposure to any light source triggers an automatic consequence. Specifically, the player suffers damage equal to their current Shade Will. This damage is a direct manifestation of the Shade Will’s nature, emphasizing how the dark aspects of one's inner self react violently to the intrusion of light.

#### Shadow Majority
When the largest portion of a player’s Will consists of shadow (i.e., when the darkened fraction overtakes their other mental defenses), the following benefits manifest permanently:

**Enhanced Darkness Affinity:** The player gains a permanent advantage in darkness.
**Altered Physical Form:** Their physical form becomes partly composed of coalescing shadows, granting them an eerie, insubstantial presence in dim or dark environments.
**Limited Teleportation:** They gain the ability to misty step once per short rest.

#### Shadow Totality
Should a player’s entire Will Pool be entirely consumed by shadow, the consequences are dire:

**Unyielding Shadow Damage:** In their final state, any damage they inflict becomes imbued with shadow energy that can be resisted by dim light or considered immune by bright light.
**Enhanced Misty Step:** As a final echo of their once vibrant self, they gain the ability to misty step a number of times equal to their proficiency bonus as a bonus action, reflecting a desperate tether to the fleeting essence of their being.
