**Bin**: [[Scape]]  
**Basin**: [[Sacrus]]  
**Eco**: [[Soul Fields]] of [[Toman Ecoss]]  
**Kingdom**: **Spira**

**Spira** are a fundamental kingdom within the **[[Toman Ecoss]]**, representing the souls that exist on **[[Scape (TTRPG)/1 Purpose Taxonomy/Complete Taxonomy/02 Eco/01 Toman Ecoss/02 Toma/Toma]]** and across the **[[Scape]]**. They are the lifeforce and essence of all living beings, playing a crucial role in the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. Spira permeate the fabric of existence, influencing the physical, spiritual, and metaphysical realms.

### Origin and Nature

The Spira kingdom is composed of souls that exist both within and beyond the Toman Ecoss, spreading across the entirety of the Scape. These entities serve as the foundational material of the great dimensional basins, powering all forms of existence. Every living creature houses a Spira, which is released from its physical form upon experiencing a **[[Spira#Mixture and Solution Death|Mixture Death]]**. The term 'Spira' originated during the **[[Natural War]]** and was used to describe the influence of the dead on the living, as depicted in ancient **[[Natura]]** symbols by early **[[Huma]]** settlers.

### Role and Domain

Spira primarily reside within the **[[Soul Fields]]**, a plane they share with the **[[Nesa]]**. Their influence extends across the Toman Planes, where they guide and shape the beliefs and actions of the living. Spira are also responsible for the generation of **anim**, the vital energy that sustains life and enables the ongoing cycles of creation and destruction within the Toman Ecoss.

### Dreams and Nightmares

Spira influence the dreams and nightmares of living creatures. The nature of these dreams depends on the saturation of belief experienced by the Spira. Starved Spira, lacking sufficient belief, often induce nightmares, especially when a creature attempts to change its beliefs in an unnatural way. Conversely, satisfied Spira, well-fed by strong belief, can lead to pleasant dreams that promote meditative benefits and spiritual growth.

### Perception and Presence

To be a Spira is to be constantly present, perceiving only what is commanded by the flow of anima and belief. The feeling of presence can be slightly altered by a creature's **[[Soul Anatomy#Print|Print]]**. The most powerful print allows a Spira to feel close to nothing, reflecting a state of balance and harmony within the creature's soul.

### Subspira

The Spira kingdom is divided into various Subspira, each representing different functions and characteristics:

**[[Gourmand Spirit]]**  
Gourmand Spirits are demon spirits created when a living creature suffers a death during an intense **[[Merchant System#Source Surge System|Surge]]** of negative belief. These souls died with extreme hatred and became ravenous in their search for belief energy, often manipulating the material world to feed on false beliefs. Gourmand Spira are not imprisoned in Arkon because of their insatiable desire to consume beliefs not attributed to any souls or Nesa in the Soul Fields.

**[[Mindless Spirit]]**  
Mindless Spirits are souls with no beliefs to sustain them, found only in Arkon. These Spira are created through **[[Never]]'s** judgment and are desperate for any belief to end their torment. They consume from any belief sphere they encounter, regardless of its composition. Creatures entering Arkon who cannot manage the anima influx of their belief sphere risk losing all beliefs and becoming an **Asylee**, a living mindless creature.

**[[Outcast and Damned Spirits]]**  
Outcast Spirits are souls trapped in Arkon by their own perceived volition, while Damned Spirits are trapped without perceived fault. The term 'perceived' denotes how Toma's inhabitants view these Subspira, regardless of the **[[Scape (TTRPG)/1 Purpose Taxonomy/Complete Taxonomy/02 Eco/01 Toman Ecoss/02 Toma/Toma#Fated Plane|fate]]** rules present in Toma.

**[[Mimic]]**  
Mimic Spira are resonant with **[[Automata]]** that, while in the Soul Fields, have connected to an object containing **[[Therium]]**. These Spira can appear as attached to objects related to their past life. Mimic Spira are only inherently evil if they are also Gourmand. 

### Interaction with Never

Never, the Arbiter and now a **[[Demon Nesa]]**, plays a vital role in guiding the Spira. He ensures that souls are judged fairly and directed along their appropriate paths, contributing to the ongoing balance of the Toman Ecoss. Through his influence, Never helps to maintain the harmony between the material and spiritual realms, fostering growth and enlightenment for all beings within his domain.

### Influence and Legacy

The Spira kingdom is a defining aspect of the Toman Ecoss, shaping the beliefs, actions, and dreams of its inhabitants. Their presence ensures the ongoing cycle of life and death, guiding creatures toward growth and enlightenment. The legacy of the Spira kingdom is woven into the fabric of existence, influencing the course of history and the evolution of the Toman Planes.
