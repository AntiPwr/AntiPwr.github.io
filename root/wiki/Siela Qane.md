**Appearance**

Siela Qane is youthful and vibrant, with tan skin and features reflecting a heritage from the sun-drenched islands of the southern seas. She has dark brown hair, often worn loose or in simple braids that catch the wind. Her eyes are lively and expressive, always reflecting her enthusiasm and intensity. Siela favors flowing robes and garments in light blue, white, and pale green, evoking the sky and open air. These clothes are airy and elegant, designed to move with the wind and never restrict her motion. She adorns herself with golden jewelry—delicate chains, earrings, and rings that glint in the sunlight and accentuate her gestures. Her presence is both sweet and demanding: she is quick to smile and encourage, but her patience is short, especially when her ambitions or the progress of her projects (such as Palas) are delayed. Her energy and charisma are matched by a determined will, making her both an inspiring leader and a formidable force when challenged.

Siela Qane is the third member of the [[Ahdom Few]], the triarchy that rules [[Hypri]] through the [[Hypri Highcourt]]. As Sky Trielder, she oversees all aerial aspects of the city's governance, including its elaborate wind harvesting infrastructure, airship transportation networks, and the critical wind highways that connect Usaka's spire cities. Her mastery of gas pressurization magic—the manipulation of air and other gaseous substances through precise pressure control—makes her the foremost authority on atmospheric sciences in eastern Toma.

Unlike her sisters, who conceal or modify aspects of their identities and ambitions, Siela operates with remarkable transparency regarding her goals. She is an outspoken devotee of [[Asceptim]] who actively promotes the faith's adoption throughout [[Usaka]], particularly in the [[Tayim Trade Republic]]. Her most ambitious ongoing project is the creation of [[Palas]], an aerial [[Imaan Plane]] dedicated to [[Asath]] that she intends to serve as a celestial sanctuary for believers.

## Origins and Religious Conviction

### Early Life and Conversion

Born to a family of atmospheric engineers who maintained some of Hypri's earliest wind harvesting systems, Siela showed prodigious talent for air manipulation from childhood. While her early training focused on practical applications, a near-fatal accident during an apprenticeship project brought her into contact with Asceptim missionaries from [[Sol Unita]].

The experience of floating between life and death—which she describes as "suspended in Asath's light"—led to her profound conversion. She emerged from recovery with both enhanced magical abilities and an unshakeable devotion to Asceptim's principles, particularly the [[Rite of Passage]] that describes ascension beyond the material plane.

### Rise to Prominence

Siela's path to the Hypri Highcourt began with her creation of the [[Cloudgardens]], an architectural marvel built entirely by hand as a shrine to [[Qa'ura]] after an early mistake cost her respect and position as the serpent's drakemaster. This stunning achievement—combining artistic beauty, engineering precision, and spiritual symbolism—restored her standing and established her reputation as both a master builder and devout visionary.

Following her reinstatement as Drakemaster, Siela joined forces with [[Ximena Lathen]] and [[Jarma Konich]] to form the Ahdom Few, contributing her aerial expertise and growing religious influence to their collective governance.

## Gas Pressurization Magic

### Theory and Application

Gas pressurization represents Siela's contribution to the sisters' complementary mastery of pressure-based magical disciplines. While [[Ximena Lathen]] controls liquids and [[Jarma Konich]] manipulates solids, Siela's domain is the manipulation of gases through precise pressure differentials and atmospheric control.

Her magical specialties include:

- **Current Crafting** – Creating and directing airflows of varying strength and complexity
- **Pressure Barrier Formation** – Establishing invisible walls or chambers through concentrated air pressure
- **Weather Manipulation** – Influencing local atmospheric conditions through controlled pressure changes
- **Sound Shaping** – Modulating air vibrations to amplify, dampen, or transform acoustic patterns

These techniques form the foundation of Hypri's wind harvesting technology, airship navigation systems, and the complex wind highways that allow travel against the [[World Gyre]]'s natural currents.

### Aerial Architecture

Siela is renowned throughout Toma for her innovations in aerial architecture—a discipline that combines traditional building techniques with sophisticated air pressure manipulation to create structures that seem to defy gravity. Her designs characteristically feature:

- Floating or partially suspended elements sustained by carefully maintained air currents
- Acoustic properties that transform wind into harmonic tones or whispered messages
- Integration of living components, particularly airborne flora that thrive in specific pressure environments
- Symbolic patterns that align with Asceptim cosmology and the [[Rites of Huma]]

Her masterworks include not only the famous Cloudgardens but also Hypri's elaborate wind highway terminals and the massive intake structures that power the city's vent system.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Sky Trielder of Hypri

As Sky Trielder in the [[Hypri Highcourt]], Siela's official responsibilities include:

- Oversight of the wind harvesting infrastructure that powers much of the city
- Management of the wind highways connecting Usaka's spire cities
- Regulation of airship traffic and aerial transportation systems
- Administration of climate control mechanisms throughout Hypri's spires

Her governance style emphasizes the integration of practical function with spiritual purpose, often framing technological innovations as steps toward greater enlightenment. This approach has made her popular with both traditional [[Dweller]] communities and progressive elements seeking modernization.

### Drakemaster of Qa'ura

Siela maintains a complex bond with [[Qa'ura]], the crystalline Amphiptere serpent also known as Aura Quartz—one of the [[Spawn of Hidraal]] controlled by the Ahdom Few. This enigmatic creature, with its translucent body that refracts light in mesmerizing patterns, represents the aerial aspect of the primordial serpents.

Through her connection with Qa'ura, Siela gains enhanced atmospheric perception and the ability to manipulate light patterns in addition to her pressure magic. She frequently communes with the serpent during extended meditation sessions, emerging with visions she translates into architectural plans or religious teachings.

    <p>The vastness of human suffering can only be matched by the depth of our self-deception. Siela Qane's "communion" with Qa'ura is not the beatific exchange she portrays, but something far more devastating.</p>
    <p>During these sessions, her consciousness fragments into prismatic shards, each reflecting a different aspect of Qa'ura's ancient trauma. What she experiences as divine inspiration is actually exposure to millennia of compressed agony—the crystallized memory of Hidraal's beheading and the subsequent isolation of her separated aspects.</p>
    <p>The architectural plans she produces afterward don't merely incorporate Asceptim symbolism; they recreate, with microscopic precision, the neural pathways of Hidraal's original consciousness. Every spire, arch, and chamber in Palas maps exactly to a section of the hydra's fractured mind. The entire project is an unconscious attempt to reassemble a brain architecture that once housed three perspectives in perfect, terrible harmony.</p>
    <p>Most tragic of all, Siela genuinely believes she serves Asath's ascension while inadvertently building a receiver designed to capture and consolidate Hidraal's scattered consciousness. When completed, Palas won't be a sanctuary—it will be a vessel, waiting for its ancient occupant to return.</p>

### Religious Leadership

Beyond her governmental role, Siela serves as High Priestess of Wind in Hypri's growing [[Asceptim]] community. She has established several shrines to [[Asath]] throughout the city, with a particular emphasis on locations where wind currents naturally converge or create unusual acoustic phenomena.

Her religious activities include:

- Regular sermons that connect wind harvesting practices to Asceptim principles
- Initiation rituals for new converts that involve controlled experiences of atmospheric pressure changes
- Diplomatic outreach to [[Sol Unita]] and other Asceptim-aligned powers
- Training acolytes in the spiritual dimensions of pressure manipulation

These efforts have significantly increased Asceptim's influence in Hypri, though the faith remains one among many in the city's diverse religious landscape.

## Personal Ambitions and Projects

### The Palas Project

Siela's most ambitious undertaking is the creation of [[Palas]], an aerial [[Imaan Plane]] devoted to [[Asath]] and designed as a perfect environment for spiritual ascension. This massive project involves:

- Cultivating and directing the only publicly accessible drake clutch in Toma
- Applying advanced pressure magic to shape an entire dimensional pocket
- Creating architecture that physically embodies Asceptim cosmology
- Establishing sustainable systems that will eventually support a permanent population

When completed, Palas is intended to serve as a second Imaan Plane of Asceptim (complementing [[Sol Proscima]]), connected through the In-Between to form a celestial network for believers. Siela envisions it as both a sanctuary for devout practitioners and a powerful symbol of Asceptim's growing influence in eastern Toma.

### Vision for Gludestit Restoration

Like her sisters, Siela seeks the eventual reunification of the [[Spawn of Hidraal]] to restore [[Gludestit]] and address the [[Hoard Sickness]] afflicting primordials. However, her approach differs significantly from her siblings:

- While [[Jarma Konich]] advocates integration with the [[Chain of Delta]]'s economic systems
- And [[Ximena Lathen]] favors a carefully controlled [[Imperial Growth]] strategy
- Siela believes restoration should occur through incorporation with [[Asceptim]] and devotion to [[Asath]]

Her vision involves a spiritual transformation of Gludestit's fundamental principles, aligning the ancient primordial belief system with Asceptim's focus on ascension and enlightenment. This controversial position has created tension with both her sisters and with traditionalist followers of Gludestit in Usaka.
