Scender is the capital city of [[Sol Unita]], a place where faith, science, and kingdom liberty are deeply intertwined. With a population of approximately 840,000 [[Huma]]-resonance, the city’s concentric layout is built in a ripple pattern, symbolizing the spiritual journey of its people—rising from the material world to enlightenment. Each ring of Scender serves a distinct function, shaping the daily lives of its inhabitants.

## Geography and Structure

Scender’s design aims to blend with the natural hilly terrain of Scender Proper, the large, uniquely shaped cliffs of [[Kyre's Point|Kyre]] and [[Luin’s Point]], and the [[Access]], which flows around [[Gaudis]] before narrowing into a river which flows through [[Southcatch]] and into Scender Proper. The southern entrance to Scender Proper features a vast ravine-like divide in the natural Aprimma wall, separating it from Southcatch. This [[Great Ripple Wall]], built concentrically around the center [[Solscept]] monument and educational center. This outer city wall forms the Due to the city's hilly terrain, the height of the wall appears lower atop the three major hills (Cless, Plume, and Riees) but rises dramatically in the valleys between them. Military-exclusive access points exist atop each hill.

### City Bands

Scender is organized into three concentric bands, each with distinct roles and character:

- **Ascension Band**: The innermost ring of the city, encompassing the central districts around [[Solscept]]. This area contains the majority of Sunstream-funded monopolistic businesses, government buildings, courts, and administrative centers. It is the political and economic heart of Scender, where the city's most influential institutions and enterprises are concentrated.

- **Acceptance Band**: The middle ring of Scender, which includes the peaks of each major hill (Cless, Plume, and Riees) as well as the troughs and valleys between them. This band serves as a transitional zone, blending residential, educational, and commercial spaces. It is home to important research facilities, schools, and communal gathering places, and acts as a bridge between the city's core and its outer neighborhoods.

- **Contribution Band**: The outermost ring, bordering the Great Ripple Wall that surrounds all of Scender. Contribution Band is characterized by its proximity to the city's boundaries and includes both areas inside the wall and some that extend beyond it. This band is where much of the city's production, trade, and external interaction occurs, with markets, workshops, and entry points for goods and people. It serves as the first point of contact for newcomers and is vital to Scender's ongoing growth and connection to the wider world.

Naval defenses of Scender operate beneath Cless, as the Access flows into [[Endem]] through a subterranean break, forming the Egress Waterfall. The [[Swirling Sea]] drives water inland toward [[Sancta]], creating a fast-moving current that naturally filters through the city. [[Ferra]], [[Bluma]], and [[Natura]] symbiotically aid citizens, contributing to infrastructure, education, policing, and agriculture.

#### Cless Hill
_Hill of Light_

[[Cless Hill]], located on the eastern side of Scender, is home to Necesse Sanct and the estate of Ophelia Necesse. It is the political and philosophical heart of the city, housing government offices, strategic viewpoints, and places of reflection.

As the highest of the three hills, Cless Hill offers a commanding view of Scender Proper, Southcatch, and the Swirling Sea. It serves as a beacon for Sol Unita’s ideals, reflecting the city’s commitment to faith and kingdom liberty. The hill’s design naturally enhances sunlight exposure, aligning with Asceptim beliefs on enlightenment and the divine significance of Asath.

#### Plume Hill
_Hill of Growth_

[[Plume Hill]], in the northwest, is the renaissance center of Scender, where artists, philosophers, and scholars gather to create, debate, and innovate. This district fosters the city’s intellectual and cultural development, attracting individuals who explore both the spiritual and material realms through art, literature, and discourse.

Monasteries, galleries, and amphitheaters are scattered across the hill, with open-air spaces designed for collaborative discussion and artistic showcases. Many who reside here live in communal residences, dedicated to creative and academic pursuits rather than commercial enterprise.

Plume Hill represents the evolving nature of Asceptim faith, where interpretations of the Rites of Huma are debated and reinterpreted. It is home to independent sects, alternative spiritual movements, and those who challenge conventional doctrine.

#### Riees Hill
_Hill of Water_

[[Riees Hill]], positioned in the southwest, is a residential hub primarily housing government officials, monopolistic business leaders, and their employees. This district is characterized by high-end housing, corporate estates, and exclusive social institutions, reflecting the city’s economic hierarchy.

While not as culturally vibrant as Plume Hill, Riees plays a crucial role in maintaining Scender’s economic stability. Many of its residents oversee operations within The Sunstream, ensuring the city’s financial and bureaucratic systems function efficiently.

Despite its exclusivity, Riees Hill is not entirely detached from the rest of the city. Public transport and access points connect it to Cress Hill and the Contribution Band, reinforcing its role as a link between governance and commerce.

## Royal Sancts and Their Properties

The governance of Scender is influenced by the four royal sancts, each of which holds a distinct philosophy on ascension and power. Their properties reflect their status and beliefs:

- [[Ballast Sanct]] maintains a large manor estate at the very center of the city, reinforcing its authority and prominence. This estate serves as a political and religious hub for those who believe in ascension through faith and structured devotion.
- [[Necesse Sanct]], tied to Queen [[Ophelia Necesse]], is located atop **Cress Hill**, signifying its belief in free will and self-directed enlightenment. This sanctuary is both a royal estate and a strategic location overseeing the city’s development.
- [[Hiamoe Sanct]] controls the [[Out and Inn]], an **Apex-Praeda (AP) restaurant** near **Luin’s Point**, across **Southcatch’s** main coastal boardwalk. The lively restaurant features dockside seating and a park behind it, offering affordable meals, though AP-certified seafood and meats remain expensive due to trade restrictions.
- [[Dianett Sanct]] operates a highly restricted research laboratory in the Acceptance Band, not far from the [[School of Coveri]]. This sanct believes in ascension through biological perfection, making their lab a site of controlled genetic experiments and studies.

## Economy, Governance, and Citizenship

Scender’s economy operates through [[The Sunstream]], a governmental flow of assets designed to maximize efficiency in business. This system naturally encourages monopolization, where dominant industries secure their place while others fit into the ecosystem of specialized roles.

Public celebrations in **Scender Proper** are often indistinguishable from religious observance, as faith permeates daily life. In contrast, [[Southcatch]], a melting pot of cultural exchange, experiences a more relaxed interpretation of faith. One example is the [[Macon Fair]], a festival reflecting the industrial and cultural values of the [[Chain of Delta]], rather than Asceptim ideals.

Citizenship in [[Sol Unita]] guarantees financial security, access to education, and healthcare, but it is difficult to obtain. While non-citizens may reside in Southcatch, they lack these government benefits. Social integration programs, work placements, and educational opportunities exist for both asylum seekers and general applicants, but individuals must provide proof of their need for refuge or demonstrate societal value within one week of entering Scender Proper.

## The School of Coveri

The [[School of Coveri]] provides free, accessible education to citizens and limited credits for refugees. Once a refugee's credits are exhausted, further education requires citizenship. The school’s central campus encircles the [[Solscept]], built on Aprimma steps, creating concentric ripples around the city’s core. These staircase structures provide access to monopolistic businesses, the [[Alevery Commons]], and hills that shape the cityscape.

The school prioritizes individual exploration within [[Sol Unita]]’s religious framework, which results in some selective censorship and disinformation, particularly in alignment with the [[Sanctan Photocenter]]. Despite this, it remains an invaluable institution for theological education and the pathway to full citizenship.

## Transportation

Scender’s transportation network is deeply intertwined with symbiotic relationships between [[Huma]], [[Ferra]], [[Bluma]], and [[Natura]]. The Access, the city’s main waterway, is supported by manmade canals, allowing seamless travel across districts.

- [[Outi Canoes]] are a public transport system, available freely without socialization requirements. They are recognizable by their traditional Scender Outi styling.
- [[Snollers]], massive snails, serve as organic elevators, adapting to the city’s hilly terrain.
- Airships frequently dock at [[Luin’s Point]], facilitating long-distance travel and trade.

## The Rites of Huma and Governance

The [[Rites of Huma]] are sacred doctrines that define Scender’s political, religious, and social landscape. These rites, recorded in [[Ester Slate|Ester Slates]], provide a framework for governance and personal ascension.

### Rites of Huma

- [[Rite of Passage]] – The foundation of Asceptim belief, describing ascension beyond the material plane.
- [[Rite of Rule]] – Positions of power require deep understanding of those under one’s influence. Rule is not the same as ownership; one must truly engage with the faith and perspective of their subjects.
- [[Rite of Recomposition]] – Encourages technological adaptation to decomposition processes, replacing the Empire Function of the [[Celia]] kingdom.
- [[Rite of Egress]] – Rooted in the exile from [[Endem]], this rite dictates never returning to past suffering, shaping Scender’s empathetic approach to refugees.
- [[Rite of Transference]] – Mandates that positions of power must transfer upon signs of enlightenment, ensuring governance remains fluid and progressive.

## Phylum Center: Asath Sanctuary

The [[Asath Sanctuary]] is the largest place of worship dedicated to [[Asath]], located on the island of [[Gaudis]] in [[Southcatch]]. It serves as a central site for religious practice, conversion, and the study of Asceptim theology. Its **Chamber of Light** refracts and concentrates sunlight, creating an immersive space for personal reflection and faith-based ceremonies.

<!-- Asath is a false Nesa -->

The sanctuary plays a major role in the cultural and religious identity of **Sol Unita**, housing key rituals such as the **Reservation with the Light**. Through these practices, the sanctuary continues to serve as a beacon of faith, guiding those who seek Asath’s divine presence.

# Establishment of Scender

Scender was established near the end of the [[Cel Blindbirth Line]], at a time when the surface of Toma was just becoming habitable again after a long period of Celia dominance. The founding of Scender marks the emergence of the [[East Sanctan Huma Lineage]], the first population of Huma to rise from Endem and reclaim the surface. This lineage established itself on Toma's terrain before other Huma lineages, who would only emerge during the following Line from Few. This early reemergence shaped Scender's unique culture, resilience, and its role as a center of faith and innovation in the Toman Ecoss.
## Familials in Scender

A [[familial]] is an insignia used to tie creatures to belief systems. These insignias are most commonly attached to phylas, classes, orders, and families. Familials in the Toman Ecoss fulfill the role a flag does in the Earthen Ecoss. Carrying a familial is a sign of one's allegiance and conviction in their belief, but it can be dangerous if you venture into hostile territories or speak to the wrong person.

Wearing a familial, due to its danger as an adventurer, is seen by others (at minimum, those of the same belief system) with admiration. Familials are sometimes used in social hierarchy systems, with governing forces using tiered or varied familial production.

In Scender, familial designs are highly individual, reflecting the diversity and unity of its people. This is encouraged by Sol Unita and is rooted in the Asceptim teaching: "We are as similar as we are different."
