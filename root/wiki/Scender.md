**Scender** is the capital [[Order]] of Sol Unita, a place where faith, science, and kingdom liberty are closely intertwined. 

## City Structure

The city’s layout is concentric, built in a ripple pattern with its highest points at the center, symbolizing the spiritual journey of its people, rising from the underworld and grasping at enlightenment.

- **Ascension Band**: The innermost ring, surrounding [[Solscept]], is home to key cultural, educational, and governmental institutions. The [[School of Coveri]] and [[Laschki Theatre]] are located here, attracting scholars and artists. The [[Alevery Commons]] serves as a meeting place for spiritual leaders and the royal family.
    
- **Acceptance Band**: This middle ring holds the affluent residential areas, featuring beautiful Primma structures. The architecture reflects the importance of spiritual and economic success, with intricate carvings and designs.
    
- **Contribution Band**: The outermost ring is where the majority of the population lives and works. This band includes the agricultural zones and industrial sectors, with a mix of housing, farmland, and production facilities. The workers here drive the economy forward, while also contributing to the kingdom’s technological advancements.
    

## Jetti Sound and South Catch

The bay area known as [[Jetti Sound]], also referred to as South Catch, is Scender’s gateway to the Swirling Sea. This bustling port is a hub for trade and transport, with goods flowing in and out of the city, while spiritual ceremonies are conducted nearby at [[Asath Sanctuary]]. The area is rich in cultural significance, blending the commercial with the spiritual.

## Economy and Governance

Scender’s economy is highly regulated by the government board, which directs resources toward religious and technological projects. Citizens compete to achieve fame, spiritual significance, and success in their fields. The city’s elite, housed in the Ascension Band, are rewarded for their contributions and are often granted audiences with the queen.

## Transportation

Scender features a unique transportation system, with [[Snoller|Snollers]]—large snails used as elevators—serving as eco-friendly means of travel across the city's steep inclines. [[Outi]] canoes are also used as taxis, navigating the streams that pass through the city, including the Jetti Sound.

## Banking System

The Bank of Scender operates a unique financial system where citizens receive money based on the frequency of their account checks. This system promotes technological advancement and prosperity, with income brackets assigned to different concentric rings of the city:

- **Contribution Band**: Receives the lowest income, with the three hill sections inside receiving the upper 50 percent of this bracket.
- **Acceptance Band**: Receives a higher income, with its three hill sections also receiving the upper 50 percent of this bracket. This bracket starts just above the contribution bracket and has twice the volume.
- **Ascension Band**: Does not receive income directly; instead, it houses the most efficient businesses that thrive based on the success of individuals outside the band. Spots in this band are highly competitive and can be lost. The Ascension Band also hosts foreigners in large-scale taverns to promote tourism and trade.

## Hills of Scender

Scender's topography includes three prominent hills within its concentric rings:

- **Riees (Southwest Hill)**: A residential area completely within the city border, characterized by its peaceful environment and limited commercialization.
- **Plume (Northwest Hill)**: An academic center that houses individuals recognized by the royal family, such as bards, researchers, inventors, and educators. This hill also features a cliff park and observatory research center.
- **Cress (East Hill)**: The largest hill, with 75 percent of its area within the city. The top of Cress houses the queen's estate, while the underside contains waterways for the navy and military barracks.

### Strategic Entrances

- **South Entrance**: Located beside Riees, serving as a primary access point to the city.

### Inspiration

Scender’s design is influenced by **Greek coastal Mediterranean architecture** with an emphasis on **solar punk** sustainability. The city blends historical traditions with futuristic innovations, representing the harmonious balance of faith, science, and culture. South Catch is much more tropical
















#### Transportation

Scender utilizes ropes attached to snails, known as [[Snaller|Snallers]], as a common elevator system throughout the city. These snails, motivated by their natural attraction to the [[Pomtum]], allow efficient movement across Scender's strict inclines and declines. These snails are a unique and eco-friendly transportation method, seamlessly integrating with Scender's natural and architectural features.

Within the Jetti Sound, outrigger canoes can also be seen, even venturing deeper within the city as taxi services. This form of canoe is called an [Outi](app://obsidian.md/Outi).


[[Sol Unita Waste Problem]]



South of Scender is a conservation zone that allows seasonal hunting, foraging, and exploration. It is basically a wilderness contained within the regions of Sol Unita. This region is considered potentially dangerous to the wild animals existing but very rarely does anything occur without the Huma first provoking.

This region is called the [[Sunwilds]]. To the southeast of the Sunwilds is the [[Belabran Cliffs]]. to the southwest and west of the sun wilds is the [[Nesil Grassland]] followed by the [[Catr Savanna]], then the [[Sansari Desert]]
