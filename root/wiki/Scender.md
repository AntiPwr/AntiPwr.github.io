Scender is the capital city of [[Sol Unita]], a place where faith, science, and kingdom liberty are deeply intertwined. With a population of approximately 840,000 [[Huma]]-resonance, the city’s concentric layout is built in a ripple pattern, symbolizing the spiritual journey of its people—rising from the material world to enlightenment. Each ring of Scender serves a distinct function, shaping the daily lives of its inhabitants.

## Geography and Structure

Scender’s design aims to blend with the natural hilly terrain of **Scender Proper**, the large, uniquely shaped cliffs of [[Kyre's Point|Kyre]] and [[Luin’s Point]], and the [[Access]], which flows around [[Gaudis]] before narrowing into a single stream through the city. The southern entrance to Scender Proper features a vast ravine-like divide in the natural **Aprimma wall**, separating it from [[Southcatch]]. This **[[Great Ripple Wall]]**, built concentrically around the [[Solscept]], marks the boundary between [[Contribution Band]] and [[Acceptance Band]]. Due to the city's hilly terrain, the height of the wall appears lower atop the three major hills but rises dramatically in the valleys between them. Military-exclusive access points exist atop each hill.

Naval defenses of Scender operate beneath [[Cress]], as the Access flows into [[Endem]] through a massive waterfall. The [[Swirling Sea]] drives water inland toward [[Sancta]], creating a fast-moving current that naturally filters through the city. [[Ferra]], [[Bluma]], and [[Natura]] symbiotically aid citizens, contributing to infrastructure, education, policing, and agriculture.

## Royal Sancts and Their Properties

The governance of Scender is influenced by the four royal sancts, each of which holds a distinct philosophy on ascension and power. Their properties reflect their status and beliefs:

- [[Ballast Sanct]] maintains a large manor estate at the very center of the city, reinforcing its authority and prominence. This estate serves as a political and religious hub for those who believe in ascension through faith and structured devotion.
- [[Necesse Sanct]], tied to Queen [[Ophelia Necesse]], is located atop **Cress Hill**, signifying its belief in free will and self-directed enlightenment. This sanctuary is both a royal estate and a strategic location overseeing the city’s development.
- [[Hiamoe Sanct]] controls the [[Out and Inn]], an **Apex-Praeda (AP) restaurant** near **Luin’s Point**, across **Southcatch’s** main coastal boardwalk. The lively restaurant features dockside seating and a park behind it, offering affordable meals, though AP-certified seafood and meats remain expensive due to trade restrictions.
- [[Dianett Sanct]] operates a highly restricted research laboratory in the Acceptance Band, not far from the [[School of Coveri]]. This sanct believes in ascension through biological perfection, making their lab a site of controlled genetic experiments and studies.

## Economy, Governance, and Citizenship

Scender’s economy operates through [[The Sunstream]], a governmental flow of assets designed to maximize efficiency in business. This system naturally encourages monopolization, where dominant industries secure their place while others fit into the ecosystem of specialized roles.

Public celebrations in **Scender Proper** are often indistinguishable from religious observance, as faith permeates daily life. In contrast, [[Southcatch]], a melting pot of cultural exchange, experiences a more relaxed interpretation of faith. One example is the [[Macon Fair]], a festival reflecting the industrial and cultural values of the [[Chain of Delta]], rather than Asceptim ideals.

Citizenship in [[Sol Unita]] guarantees financial security, access to education, and healthcare, but it is difficult to obtain. While non-citizens may reside in Southcatch, they lack these government benefits. Social integration programs, work placements, and educational opportunities exist for both asylum seekers and general applicants, but individuals must provide proof of their need for refuge or demonstrate societal value within one week of entering Scender Proper.

## The School of Coveri

The [[School of Coveri]] provides free, accessible education to citizens and limited credits for refugees. Once a refugee's credits are exhausted, further education requires citizenship. The school’s central campus encircles the [[Solscept]], built on Aprimma steps, creating concentric ripples around the city’s core. These staircase structures provide access to monopolistic businesses, the [[Alevery Commons]], and hills that shape the cityscape.

The school prioritizes individual exploration within [[Sol Unita]]’s religious framework, which results in some selective censorship and disinformation, particularly in alignment with the [[Sanctan Photocenter]]. Despite this, it remains an invaluable institution for theological education and the pathway to full citizenship.

## Transportation

Scender’s transportation network is deeply intertwined with symbiotic relationships between [[Huma]], [[Ferra]], [[Bluma]], and [[Natura]]. The Access, the city’s main waterway, is supported by manmade canals, allowing seamless travel across districts.

- [[Outi Canoes]] are a public transport system, available freely without socialization requirements. They are recognizable by their traditional Scender Outi styling.
- [[Snollers]], massive snails, serve as organic elevators, adapting to the city’s hilly terrain.
- Airships frequently dock at [[Luin’s Point]], facilitating long-distance travel and trade.

## The Rites of Huma and Governance

The [[Rites of Huma]] are sacred doctrines that define Scender’s political, religious, and social landscape. These rites, recorded in [[Ester Slates]], provide a framework for governance and personal ascension.

### Rites of Huma

- [[Rite of Passage]] – The foundation of Asceptim belief, describing ascension beyond the material plane.
- [[Rite of Rule]] – Positions of power require deep understanding of those under one’s influence. Rule is not the same as ownership; one must truly engage with the faith and perspective of their subjects.
- [[Rite of Recomposition]] – Encourages technological adaptation to decomposition processes, replacing the Empire Function of the [[Celia]] kingdom.
- [[Rite of Egress]] – Rooted in the exile from [[Endem]], this rite dictates never returning to past suffering, shaping Scender’s empathetic approach to refugees.
- [[Rite of Transference]] – Mandates that positions of power must transfer upon signs of enlightenment, ensuring governance remains fluid and progressive.

## Phylum Center: Asath Sanctuary

The [[Asath Sanctuary]] is the largest place of worship dedicated to [[Asath]], located on the island of [[Gaudis]] in [[Southcatch]]. It serves as a central site for religious practice, conversion, and the study of Asceptim theology. Its **Chamber of Light** refracts and concentrates sunlight, creating an immersive space for personal reflection and faith-based ceremonies.

The sanctuary plays a major role in the cultural and religious identity of **Sol Unita**, housing key rituals such as the **Reservation with the Light**. Through these practices, the sanctuary continues to serve as a beacon of faith, guiding those who seek Asath’s divine presence.
