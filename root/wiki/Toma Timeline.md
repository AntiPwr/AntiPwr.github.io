**Bin:** [[Scape]]  
**Basin:** [[Sacrus]]  
**Eco:** [[Toma]] of [[Toman Ecoss]]  

The timeline of the [[Toman Ecoss]] is divided into significant Lines, defined by eras between shifts of the [[Dance of Spira]], as evident through changes in the [[World Gyre]]'s rotation. These Lines are marked by profound transformations in the nature of existence, belief, balance of power, and the planar ecosystem as a whole.

Each Line represents not merely a chronological period but a distinct cosmic arrangement—a specific configuration of spiritual and material forces that shapes all aspects of life within the plane. The transition between Lines occurs when the Dance of Spira shifts direction, typically accompanied by major upheavals in both the physical world and the metaphysical realms.

## Cosmic Origins

### Point Zero: Before Creation

Before the plane was created, [[Zlellis and O'nume]] consumed from the [[Sourcewaters]] of the [[Godan Ecoss]] in the [[Fractal Waters]] and met. Their initial encounter would establish the fundamental duality that would eventually manifest as Toma itself.

## The Major Lines

### Line from Origin (0 R.T. - 634 R.T.)
**The Beginning**

- The plane was created by the [[Goda]]. The voices of their argument lingered through the plane of Toma.
- The Goda argued and eventually left the plane, setting the stage for the emergence of other forces. The [[Nesa]] were slowly birthed during this period.
- These Nesa established a natural structure through the voices of their gods, until a significant conflict disrupted the emerging order.
- The [[Decara]] Kingdom worshipped one of these two primordial voices as their leader, calling him [[Voices#Scream|Scream]].

This foundational period established the basic physical and metaphysical laws that would govern Toma throughout all subsequent Lines. The departure of the Goda left space for the development of autonomous forces and beings, beginning the plane's journey toward self-governance.

### Versagoth Line (634 R.T. - 835 R.T.)
**Natural War**

- A time of chaos and conflict known as the [[Natural War]], where the primal forces of nature and emerging lifeforms clashed for dominance without the guidance of gods.
- [[Gorisain]], a Decaran [[Dreg]], achieved [[Source Surge Types#Nascension|Nascension]] through the [[Two Virus Mythos]]. In this process, he claimed the voice of Scream.
- The Decara and Natura fought a 205-year Natural War that reshaped the landscape and power dynamics of the plane.

The Versagoth Line ended with a significant shift in the Dance of Spira, though this was a broken line transition as no overwhelming force emerged victorious. Instead, the creation of [[Dar]] as a counterbalance to Toma maintained a tenuous equilibrium between constructive and destructive forces.

### Line from Maturation (835 R.T. - 1,386 R.T.)
**Line of Nature Harmony**

- A period of balance and harmony between the elemental kingdoms: [[Bluma]], [[Natura]], [[Ferra]], and [[Celia]].
- The kingdoms existed in a state of relative peace, with natural cycles and laws governing their interactions.
- [[Huma]] and [[Monstra]] were introduced to the plane, adding new dimensions of consciousness and potential.
- The [[Goda]] returned, believing that everything was stable and in harmony, not realizing the underlying tensions developing beneath the surface.

This 551-year period represented the longest sustained era of relative peace in Toma's history, allowing for the development of complex ecosystems and the early foundations of civilization. The introduction of Huma consciousness would ultimately prove transformative for the plane's future development.

    <p class="feathermark-attribution">Corvi's Feathermark</p>
    <p>The grand deception we maintain in our histories is the notion that the Line of Nature Harmony was actually harmonious. Archaeological evidence contradicts this comforting myth at every turn.</p>
    <p>I've examined soil layers from this period: they're rich with ash deposits, irregular mineral distributions suggesting catastrophic events, and organic remains showing evidence of widespread suffering. What we call "harmony" was merely a different form of conflict—one operating on a slower timescale, with dominance expressed through gradual territorial expansion rather than outright warfare.</p>
    <p>The Goda didn't return because harmony had been achieved; they returned because the plane had developed precisely the kind of self-sustaining conflict cycle they had designed it for. Their satisfaction wasn't with peace but with the elegant perpetual motion machine of competing kingdoms they had created—each rising and falling in sequence, none able to permanently dominate.</p>
    <p>What we remember as an age of balance was actually the first successful implementation of controlled instability—the cosmic equivalent of keeping a spinning top perpetually wobbling but never quite falling.</p>

### Truthsayer Line (1,386 R.T. - 1,698 R.T.)
**Age of Voices**

- The [[Godan Voices]] ruled over the planes through the [[Nesa]]. Two voices were always present in the Toman Ecoss, called [[Scream]] and [[Whisper]].
- [[Gorisain]] captured a voice, spreading hatred and corruption through oral and religious communication. Some [[Huma]] began to believe in [[Basilica]], a distorted faith spread by Gorisain's influence.
- This grew Gorisain's power within Dar. This god, to the Huma, became known as His Scream.
- [[Corvi]] tried to capture another voice to combat this but failed in harnessing its power, splitting his form. Over time he attempted to rebuild himself but couldn't seem to get a hold of [[Kee]], the holder of the second voice he had lost.
- This period marked the first formation of the [[Chain of Delta]], with its resilience mimicking Corvi's own fragmented persistence.

The 312-year Truthsayer Line saw the emergence of sophisticated theological structures and the beginning of organized religion as a major force in Toman societies. The competition between divine voices established patterns of spiritual conflict that would persist throughout subsequent Lines.

### Phan Tenscia Line (1,698 R.T. - 1,972 R.T.)
**Era of Instability**

- The [[Gradient]] was destabilized by [[Behinyu]] and [[Never]], causing [[Spira]] and magic to spiral out of control.
- This era saw the dominance of Spira, with the boundaries between the material and spiritual worlds becoming increasingly blurred.
- Magical phenomena became unpredictable and often dangerous, leading to significant shifts in how societies approached and regulated supernatural powers.

The destabilization of fundamental metaphysical systems during this 274-year period created both tremendous challenges and opportunities for advancement in understanding the nature of reality itself. Many of the magical theories and practices still used in current times have their origins in adaptations developed during this turbulent era.

### Line from Loss
**Period of Rebirth**

- A line of growth that emerged from the loss of fundamental aspects of life.
- Societies rebuilt from the metaphysical instability of the previous Line, developing new philosophical approaches to existence.
- This period saw the beginning of more structured approaches to both spiritual and material development, with an emphasis on preservation of knowledge.

The exact duration of this Line remains debated among scholars, as records from this period show inconsistencies in timekeeping methods, possibly due to lingering effects from the Gradient destabilization.

### Taxotheir Line
**Systematic Classification**

- The beginning of [[Purpose Taxonomy]] was formed during this era, establishing frameworks for understanding the relationships between different aspects of existence.
- A time marked by warfare over [[Hollow Resource]], with the different kingdoms vying for control over these valuable materials.
- The systematic approach to categorization developed during this period would have lasting impacts on how future generations understood their world and their place within it.

This Line saw the emergence of many of the organizational structures and classification systems still used in the Current Line, representing a crucial step in the intellectual development of Toman societies.

### Cel Blindbirth Line
**Celia Dominance**

- A time of [[Celia]] dominance, where the surface of the plane became inhospitable due to the overwhelming presence of decomposition forces.
- The [[Huma]] were forced underground, retreating from the dangerous and decaying surface world.
- This period of hardship and adaptation fundamentally transformed Huma society, creating cultural patterns and survival strategies that would influence their development for Lines to come.

The retreat underground during this Line created a psychological impact still evident in certain architectural styles and cultural practices, particularly a tendency toward enclosed spaces with artificial illumination mimicking natural light.

### Line from Few
**Reclamation and Rebuilding**

- The [[Huma]] emerged from their subterranean refuges, reclaiming the surface of the plane for the first time since the Taxotheir Line.
- Societies began to rebuild, adapting to the new realities of the world after the Celia dominance had subsided.
- This Line culminated in the [[War of Conclusions]] (510-540), a conflict that would reshape political boundaries and power structures.

The 540-year Line from Few represented a crucial period of recovery and adaptation, as Huma and other conscious beings reestablished their presence in a world transformed by the previous dominance of Celia forces.

### Current Line
**Technological Advancement**

- The [[Automata]] are introduced, bringing unprecedented technological capabilities to Toma.
- This line is marked by rapid advancement and the growing influence of non-organic life forms.
- [[Therium]] is revealed to the world, offering new possibilities for interaction between organic and constructed consciousness.
- [[Primordials]] go extinct, marking the end of an ancient lineage of beings who once shaped the fundamental nature of the plane.
- The [[Battle of the Rising Sea]] represents a major conflict with far-reaching consequences for coastal regions.
- The formation of the [[Sea Level Party]], including notable figures such as [[Laika Acker]], [[Lavinho]], and [[Mellifera]], occurs in the 40th year of this Line.

As the Current Line continues to unfold, societies throughout Toma grapple with rapid changes and shifting power dynamics, navigating a world increasingly shaped by technological innovation and the aftermath of primordial extinction.

### Autka Hostilis Line
**Projected Future: Virus Dominance**

- The projected future line, where constructs and machines rise to dominance, displacing organic life.
- [[Fuscia Lustin]] is killed, removing a major stabilizing force from the political landscape.
- [[Nadie]] dominate middle [[Wyldere]], expanding their influence across previously diverse territories.
- Automata + Decara (a resonant called a Virus) overrun the world, fundamentally transforming the nature of consciousness on the plane.
- Gorisain aims to claim his dominion on Toma after growing Dar for 4,700 years, potentially fulfilling ambitions set in motion during the Versagoth Line.

This potential future represents one of several possible paths for Toma's development, with current actions across the plane potentially altering or reinforcing this trajectory.

## Calendar and Timekeeping

### Calendar System

A year in the Toman Ecoss is 360 days long, divided into 10 months of 36 days each. This calendar accounts for the effects of Shortstars and Longstars, which influence the length of days and nights.

- **Day Length**: 20 hours
- **Week Length**: 10 days
- **Month Length**: 36 days
- **Year Length**: 360 days

The current calendar is split into two sections, reflecting the dual nature of the plane's timekeeping and its reliance on celestial events.

### Months of the Toman Calendar

The ten months of the Toman calendar preserve ancient linguistic roots, some dating back before the Cel Blindbirth Line:

1. **Jaks** - First month, associated with new beginnings and planning
2. **Mempith** - From "pith" or inner sanctum, a time for introspection
3. **Atton** - Month of community building and collaboration
4. **Fer** - Associated with growth and natural development
5. **N'jevr** - Derived from an old name for Never before Arkon was closed off
6. **Sempr** - Month of middle stability and balance
7. **Dism** - Period of harvest and gathering
8. **Alm** - Associated with preparation for darker seasons
9. **Mule** - Month of reflection and ancestral remembrance
10. **Jaol** - Final month, carrying ancient linguistic significance related to completion

### Line Duration

Lines typically last around 500 years, though this can vary significantly based on cosmic factors:

- **Spira Storage**: The end of a Line is triggered by a change in the Dance of Spira's rotation, which is influenced by the number of souls stored by [[Never]].
- As Never tends to gain more souls than he loses, Lines tend to be lengthy, averaging close to 500 years.
- The World Gyre rate of change follows a positive exponential curve, accelerating as a Line approaches its conclusion.

## The Gyre Shift Phenomenon

The Gyre Shift refers to the change in rotation of the [[World Gyre]], signifying the end of a Line. This cosmic event has profound implications for all aspects of life in Toma:

- **Biome Shifting**: Ecosystems gradually migrate in the direction of the gyre, with [[Natura Nesa]] using detritus to fuel the growth of the plane.
- **Climate Changes**: [[Sol Unita]] believes the plane is getting hotter because of the World Gyre swapping direction toward them following the Line from Few.
- **Spiritual Resonance**: Belief systems often undergo significant transformations during Gyre Shifts, as the metaphysical underpinnings of reality briefly become more apparent to mortal perception.

These shifts represent crucial turning points in Toman history, moments when the accumulated tensions and developments of a Line resolve themselves into new patterns that will define the era to come.
