## The Severing of Alwa

According to legend, the Presceptists confronted the primordial beast Alwa on the continent of Sancta. In a cataclysmic storm at the center of the plane, they severed Alwa’s colossal, fleshy fungal legs, causing her to topple into the depths of the sea. The remains of her legs became the landforms known as [[Kyre's Point|Kyre]] and [[Luin's Point]], which have since fueled the prosperity and spiritual foundation of Sol Unita society through its troves of [[Aprima]].

## Legacy in the Rites of Huma

The Reins of Alwa became the mythic justification for the [[Rite of Recomposition]], which teaches that Huma must guide the cycles of life and death, rather than be consumed by them. Over time, the story influenced all [[Rites of Huma]], evolving as Sol Unita society progressed. The myth is invoked to justify technological advancement, social order, and the rejection of unchecked Celia power.

## The Sol Reformation

At the turn of the [[Current Line]], following the [[War of Conclusions]], the [[Sol Reformation]] brought subtle progressive changes to the Rites of Huma for most kingdoms—though for Celia, these changes led to further marginalization. The myth of the Reins of Alwa remains a touchstone for reformers and traditionalists alike, symbolizing the ongoing struggle to balance progress, faith, and the lessons of the past.
