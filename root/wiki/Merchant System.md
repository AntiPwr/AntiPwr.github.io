# Merchant System

*"Two roads diverged in a wood, and I, I took the one less traveled by, and that had made all the difference."* - **Robert Frost**

The [[Merchant System]] encompasses a grouping of belief-based magic frameworks within the Toman Ecoss, including [[Source Surge|Source Surges]], [[Will]], [[Discovery Inspiration]], and [[Sea Level Spell|Sea Level Spells]]. Its purpose is to let characters harness the power of their beliefs, translating them into tangible abilities that enhance both roleplay and narrative immersion.
