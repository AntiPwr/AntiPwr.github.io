**Hollow Resources** are vital materials within the [[Toman Ecoss]], formed through [[Wasting Event|Wasting Events]]. These resources are the remnants of organic and inorganic matter that have undergone transformative deaths, leaving behind potent and highly valuable substances. Hollow Resources serve as the lifeblood of many civilizations, fueling technological advancements, spiritual practices, and economic systems.

## Formation

Hollow Resources are created when large quantities of matter have their contained souls severed, also known as waste events. These transformative processes result in concentrated deposits of resources with unique properties. The specific type of Hollow Resource produced depends on the nature of the original material and the kingdom to which it belonged.

## Types of Hollow Resources

- **[[Therium]]**: A dark, dense material from the [[Decara]] and [[Spira]] kingdoms, known for its ability to conduct spiritual energy, making it essential for rituals and the creation of powerful artifacts.
- **[[Photometal]]**: A unique resource from the [[Bluma]] kingdom, capable of imprinting and storing thoughts and beliefs when exposed to light, with its appearance shifting based on light exposure.
- **[[Grame]]**: Associated with the [[Decara]] kingdom, Grame is known for its terrifying ability to consume belief and draw creatures toward decay.
- **[[Dai and Iko Stones]]**: Paired stones from the [[Ferra]] kingdom, formed when a predator and prey die together and decay into the earth. The Dai (predator) stone is always a dull, low-value shade or tone, while the Iko (prey) stone is always a pastel, high-value tint. Each pair is attuned to its own frequency, allowing only the paired stones to communicate. Used in spiritual practices, rituals, and as tracking implants (notably in Sol Unita). The stones symbolize the eternal chase and the predator-prey dynamic, with their resonance shaped by the beliefs of the creatures involved. See [[Dai and Iko Stones]] for full details.
- **[[Primma]] and [[Aprima]]**: Originating from the [[Celia]] kingdom, Primma is a versatile material used in construction and spiritual practices, with its purity reflecting the proximity to ascension. [[Aprima]] is its purest form, said to be a remnant of the [[Primordial]] [[Alwa]].

## Importance and Use

Hollow Resources are integral to the functioning of the Toman Ecoss, providing essential materials for technological innovation, spiritual practices, and economic stability. The control and trade of these resources often lead to power struggles and are key factors in the development and history of civilizations across the Toman Ecoss.

Hollow Resources are created through ideology-attuned death events, often considered mass by population, or intense by emotional connection (belief event).
