**Hollow Resources** are vital materials within the [[Toman Ecoss]], formed through [[Wasting Event|Wasting Events]]. These resources are the remnants of organic and inorganic matter that have undergone transformative deaths, leaving behind potent and highly valuable substances. Hollow Resources serve as the lifeblood of many civilizations, fueling technological advancements, spiritual practices, and economic systems.

## Formation

Hollow Resources are created when large amounts of organic or inorganic matter undergo an ideology-attuned death event—either a mass or belief-charged death. The souls once contained in that matter are severed, leaving behind concentrated deposits imbued with spiritual energy and belief. Each resource’s nature depends on the origin material and its Kingdom (a belief-aligned category of life in the world’s cosmology). These materials are extraordinarily powerful and coveted; entire civilizations have risen and fallen over their control. For artificers and spiritual engineers, Hollow Resources present an opportunity to craft unique devices and implants that channel their inherent magical properties.

## Types of Hollow Resources

- **[[Therium]]**: A dark, dense Hollow Metal of immense versatility and the cornerstone of many spiritual technologies. Formed in the feeding pits of Dar after catastrophic events, Therium contains the echo of a soul’s will, making it uniquely suited to infuse with belief and consciousness. It conducts spiritual energy and stores belief, and is the signature implant material for artificers and Pith Mechanics.
- **[[Photometal]]**: A unique resource from the [[Bluma]] kingdom, capable of imprinting and storing thoughts and beliefs via light exposure. Its material appearance shifts under different lighting, and it is used for slates and visors that store illusions or memories.
- **[[Grame]]**: Associated with the [[Decara]] kingdom, Grame is known for its terrifying ability to consume belief and draw creatures toward decay. It is used for lures, vials, and traps that sap resolve or attract decay-aligned creatures.
- **[[Dai and Iko Stones]]**: Paired stones from the [[Ferra]] kingdom, formed when a predator and prey die together and decay into the earth. Each pair is attuned to its own frequency, allowing only the paired stones to communicate. Used as untraceable communicators or trackers, they symbolize the eternal chase and the predator-prey dynamic.
- **[[Primma]] and [[Aprima]]**: Originating from the [[Celia]] kingdom, Primma is a versatile material used in construction and spiritual practices, with its purity reflecting the proximity to ascension. [[Aprima]] is its purest form, said to be a remnant of the primordial [[Alwa]]. Beads and talismans made from Primma promote healing, growth, or miraculous effects.


## Narrative and Gameplay Impact

Hollow Resources are integral to the functioning of the Toman Ecoss, providing essential materials for technological innovation, spiritual practices, and economic stability. The control and trade of these resources often lead to power struggles and are key factors in the development and history of civilizations across the Toman Ecoss. Their discovery can drive entire campaigns, and the quest for rare resources like Therium is often a grand adventure in itself.

For players and storytellers, Hollow Resources offer not only mechanical benefits but also rich storytelling hooks: the quest for Therium, the moral choices around using Grame’s decay, the wonder of photometal’s living light, the mystery of Primma’s connection to ascension, and the symbolic weight of Dai and Iko stones. Each resource-based implant or item provides opportunities for unique relationships, moral dilemmas, and dramatic consequences. The risks of using Hollow Resources are real—Grame can erode resolve, Photometal may record curses, and the Therium implant ties a part of one’s soul to another being, with all the narrative consequences that entails.
