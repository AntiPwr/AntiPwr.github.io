Dai and Iko Stones are a unique type of [[Hollow Resource]] that embody the dichotomous relationship of predator and prey, originating from Mohrsmünt (Apex) and Amarvena (Praeda)-aligned Ferran death events. The stones themselves are physical manifestations of the [[Dai'iko|Dai-Iko]] relationship of [[Apex and Praeda]].

These stones form only when a predator and prey die together, often in a chase or through mutual trickery, and their bodies decay into the earth. The stones always form in pairs—one Dai (predator), one Iko (prey)—with their colors never intermingling, creating striking natural art displays underground.

## Formation and Resonance

Dai and Iko Stones are created through [[Mixture Death]], where the beliefs and characteristic functions of the deceased Ferran creatures influence the resulting material. The resonance of the stones is shaped by the two primary phyla, Mohrsmünt (Apex) and Amarvena (Praeda), which define the predator-prey dynamic. Each pair of stones is attuned to its own unique frequency, allowing only the paired stones to communicate with each other.

## Properties and Usage

- **Dai (Predator) Stone**: Always a dull, low-value shade or tone. The Dai stone can sense the direction of its paired Iko stone and grants increased movement speed toward it. If the Iko stone is destroyed, the Dai stone becomes inert but compels the holder to seek out the Iko to complete the hunt.
- **Iko (Prey) Stone**: Always a pastel, high-value tint. The Iko stone senses the proximity of its Dai pair and grants advantage to perception checks to find the Dai. If the Dai stone is destroyed, the Iko stone will fall out of the holder's body when near its pair, compelling the holder to reunite the stones.
- The stones communicate vibrations only with their pair, symbolizing the eternal chase. They are used in spiritual practices, communication devices, and tracking implants (notably in Sol Unita, where Dai is given to the government and Iko to the individual).

## Cultural and Symbolic Significance

Dai and Iko Stones are central to the [[Mythos of the Endless Hunt]] in Ferra culture, representing the unending cycle of predator and prey. The stones reinforce the philosophies of Mohrsmünt and Amarvena, with Apex (predator) depicted as remorseless and Praeda (prey) as seeking love and escape. Their relationship is often seen as unrequited and sapphic, with each reincarnation offering new opportunities for the chase and for growth.

## Hollow Resources and Unique Beliefs

As Hollow Resources, Dai and Iko Stones are profoundly shaped by the beliefs of the creatures that died to create them. Mass death events, such as the fall of an [[Imaan Plane]], can create new, unique Hollow Resources infused with the collective resonance of those who perished, making such stones rare and highly valued.
