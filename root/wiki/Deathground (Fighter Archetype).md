Born where kingdoms fell and earth lay scorched—ravaged by cruel empires, primordial beasts, or cataclysmic storms—Deathground Fighters are wasteland survivors who refuse victimhood. They stand on ground painted red by ancestors long dead or hunted to extinction, channeling their anim to forge unbreakable resolve. In the crucible of desperation, they’ve learned that the fiercest loyalty is to one’s blood and belief: when no retreat remains, one either dies—or becomes the champion of [[Deathground]].

### **Level 3 – Grounded Stance**

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Athletics if you don’t already have it. While wielding a bludgeoning weapon, you gain:

- **Crashing Blow.** Whenever you hit a creature that is prone or knocked up, you deal an extra 1d4 bludgeoning damage as your momentum shatters their balance.
    
- **Immovable Mass.** You count as one size larger for grappling and shoving.
    
- **Kanabo Mastery.** When you wield a heavy bludgeoning weapon (a maul or your signature kanabo), your attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19–20 against a creature you have grappled, knocked up, or knocked prone.
    

### **Level 3 – Endemic Rupture**

_(Reaction when a creature is knocked up)_  
Choose one:

- **Batting Blow.** Make a melee weapon attack; on a hit, you deal damage normally and send the target flying 15 feet. If it collides with another creature, both take 1d6 bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a DC Str save or fall prone.
    
- **Clamp and Crush.** You have advantage on this grapple attempt and, if you succeed, the creature is held aloft. While the target remains grappled by you, your allies score a critical hit against it on a roll of 19–20. While grappled by you, a creature can only be critically hit once on a 19, meaning subsequent attacks after the first critical hit must then be a natural 20. 
    
- **Siphon Anim.** You channel ancestral anim into your limbs. The creature takes necrotic damage equal to 1d10 + your Strength modifier, and you regain hit points equal to half the damage dealt.
    

_(Endemic Rupture uses per long rest equal to your Strength modifier, minimum 1.)_

### **Level 7 – Graven Grip**

_(Bonus Action)_  
Choose one creature you see within 30 feet (no more than one size larger). It must succeed on a Str save (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or you choose:

- **Death Grip.** You yank the creature so fiercely it lands at your feet—if it was airborne, it takes falling damage equal to 1d6 per 10 feet fallen before crashing prone.
    
- **Drag Down.** If the target is already knocked up (for example, by your Endemic Rupture), you may use this Bonus Action **instead of your Endemic Rupture reaction** to pull it earthward. It falls prone, takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen, and on a failed Con save is stunned until the end of your next turn.
    

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.

### **Level 10 – Barren Exchange**

Years of drinking the blood-faith of your forebears have honed your draining rites.

When you use **Siphon Anim**, you may target up to **two creatures** within 10 ft. that are grappled, prone, or knocked up. Additionally, for each target you can choose one:

- **Belief of Fear.** Wisdom save or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn.
    
- **Belief of Fury.** The target is taunted (disadvantage on attacks against anyone but you) until the start of your next turn.
    

Each effect applies once per use.

### **Level 15 – Weight of Death**

Your very presence warps gravity and spirit, a living bulwark.

- You emit a **10-ft. aura**: any creature in it forcibly moved (pulled, launched, or shoved) takes bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier.
    
- You cannot be knocked prone or forced to move unless you allow it.
    
- When you **grapple** a creature, it immediately takes bludgeoning damage equal to your weapon’s damage die + your Strength modifier.

### **Level 18 – Imaan Ascendance**

_“This ground is your birthright—let none defile it.”_

At the zenith of your ancestral rite, you rend reality itself and pull your chosen prey and their ilk into a crucible of belief.

**Once per long rest, Action.** You target one creature you can see within 60 ft. and that creature’s **taxon** (the Purpose Taxonomy rank it identifies with). You drag that creature and any willing allies of the same taxon into a 30‑ft radius **Imaan Plane** overlaid on the material world for 1 minute. This is a fight to the death between taxons.

- **Declare the Arena.** In dramatic collaboration with the DM, conjure a thematic battleground tied to your shared lineage—perhaps a ruined coliseum where ancestral phantoms cheer, a blasted city plaza ringed by monoliths of stone, or a spectral warcamp crackling with ancestral warhorns.
    
- **Taxon Tether.** Only creatures belonging to your chosen taxon may freely enter or exit; all others are bound within until one taxon prevails or duration ends.
    
- **Home-Ground Advantage.** Allies of the declared taxon gain advantage on attacks, checks, and saves. Once per turn when you damage a non-taxon foe, you gain temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.
    
- **Ancestral Echoes.** At the start of each of your turns, one non-taxon creature that failed its initial save is knocked prone as translucent warriors repeat your ancestors’ onslaught beneath their feet.
    

**Collapse.** When the minute expires or only one taxon remains:

- Surviving non-taxon creatures must succeed on a Dex save or take 6d10 bludgeoning as the plane shatters back to wasteland.
    
- Survivors of your taxon emerge unscathed, their victory sanctified by a chorus of ancestral anim.
    

This arena, like the blood in your veins, demands a sacrifice—let it be theirs.

# Balancing Analysis

Great, I’ll analyze the Deathground Fighter subclass with a focus on action economy, damage throughput, and tactical efficiency—especially in outnumbered encounters. I’ll evaluate each level’s feature for power pacing, bonus action/reaction saturation, and potential ability conflicts, while honoring the mechanics and style you’ve crafted. I’ll report back with a breakdown and concrete feedback on each feature’s mechanical footprint.

# Balancing the **Deathground** Fighter Subclass

## Action Economy Considerations

**Level 3 – Grounded Stance & Endemic Rupture:** At 3rd level, the subclass introduces **Endemic Rupture** as an **Action** with a built-in follow-up **Reaction**, plus several passive bonuses from **Grounded Stance**. This is a lot of action economy use early on, so it’s important to ensure it’s not too **overloaded**:

- **Action + Reaction Combo:** Using Endemic Rupture lets the fighter spend their Action to launch an enemy (`knocked up`) and then **immediately use their Reaction** for a follow-up (**Batting Blow**, **Clamp and Crush**, or **Siphon Anim**). This effectively gives a 3rd-level fighter an **extra attack/effect** in the same round (via Reaction). It’s powerful, but it’s **gated by limited uses** (uses per long rest equal to Strength mod) and a saving throw. If the enemy passes the Strength save, the fighter’s action is essentially wasted – a significant risk balancing the reward.
    
    - **Rules for Reaction on Your Turn:** Using a Reaction on your own turn is **unusual but rules-legal** (e.g. you can **Reaction** to your own trigger). The subclass explicitly allows it when you knock a creature up. The cost is that you **lose your Reaction** for the rest of the round (so no opportunity attacks or other reactions until your next turn). In fights where you’re outnumbered, you’ll have to weigh using your Reaction for **Endemic Rupture** combos vs. saving it for opportunity attacks on enemies moving past you. This trade-off actually helps balance the action economy – you get a potent combo on your turn, but give up possible off-turn actions.
        
    - **Bonus Action:** At 3rd level, there’s **no subclass feature using your Bonus Action** yet. This means a Deathground Fighter can still use things like Second Wind (or an off-hand attack, etc.) normally. No conflict here. The **Grounded Stance** bonuses (extra damage die, improved crit range, count as larger for grapples) are **passive** and don’t consume actions.
        
- **Action Surge Interaction:** As a fighter, you have Action Surge (1/short rest at these levels). A big question is whether Action Surge lets you **double up** on these combos in one turn. You _can_ Action Surge after using Endemic Rupture. For example, you could: Action (Endemic Rupture + Reaction follow-up), then Action Surge for additional weapon attacks. This yields a very high burst damage/CC round, but remember you still only have one Reaction per round – you **cannot** do a second Reaction during the Action Surge action. In playtest, this is strong but seems **within reason for a limited resource**. Fighters are known for big nova rounds with Action Surge, and here the combo is comparable: a fighter with a greatsword at level 3 could Action Surge for 2 attacks (~20 damage if both hit). With Endemic Rupture, you might deal a similar ~15–20 damage (1d8+Str + a weapon hit + maybe collision) plus inflict prone/knockback. It’s potent, but uses one of your per-day Endemic charges.
    
- **“Forgo this reaction” Clarification (Level 7 preview):** You’ll notice the text “_if it’s already knocked up, you forgo this reaction to pull it earthward_” under **Graven Grip**. This implies that at 7th level, when you gain the **Bonus Action** Graven Grip, you **must choose** between using your **Reaction from Endemic Rupture** or using your **Bonus Action Drag Down** on a knocked-up target. In other words, you **can’t slam the same creature twice** in one sequence. This is a crucial balancing element for action economy: it prevents a scenario like “Action knocks them up, Reaction bats them, _then_ Bonus Action slams them again.” So one piece of feedback is to **make this clear in the wording**. For example, Graven Grip (Drag Down) might say: “_If the target is already knocked up (for example, by your Endemic Rupture), you can use your Bonus Action **instead of your Endemic Rupture reaction** to pull it earthward…_”. This clarity will ensure players know they can’t double-dip on the same trigger.
    

**Level 7 – Graven Grip:** At 7th level, you introduce a **Bonus Action** feature (Graven Grip), while still potentially using the Reaction from Endemic Rupture. This means by level 7 a fighter could, in one turn, use **Action + Bonus + Reaction** if circumstances allow – a heavy action economy load, but again limited by resources and triggers:

- **Bonus Action Pull (Death Grip):** This is a ranged control move (30 ft range) that forces a Strength save or drags a creature to your feet **and knocks it prone**. No damage on the pull itself, just positioning and the prone condition. Using your Bonus Action for control is a great idea to let the fighter engage multiple foes when outnumbered. It competes with other Bonus Action uses (Second Wind, Polearm Master attacks, etc.), but by level 7 many fighters don’t have a constant BA attack unless they multiclass or take certain feats. So it gives them a compelling use of the Bonus Action without overcrowding it. **Action economy is still okay here** – you generally won’t have another subclass BA option, so Graven Grip slots in nicely.
    
- **Combo with Endemic Rupture:** Here’s a likely combo at 7: **Action** to Endemic Rupture one enemy (knock it up), then **Bonus Action** Graven Grip on _another_ enemy to yank it prone, and **Reaction** (from Endemic) to follow-up on the first enemy. This means in one round you’ve potentially disabled two foes (one launched and smacked, another dragged prone). That’s strong, but note the constraints: you needed to have multiple enemies within 10 ft and 30 ft, you needed one to fail a Strength save to be knocked up and the other to fail to be pulled, and you expended **two limited resources** (one Endemic use and one Graven Grip use). Given the subclass’s theme of excelling when outnumbered, this **feels appropriate** – it’s doing the job it’s meant to do, using resources efficiently to control a crowd. Just be aware as a DM/player that it’s a lot happening on one turn. You might want to ensure other players aren’t feeling overshadowed by this burst of control; but since you can’t do it every round (limited uses per long rest), it should balance out over an adventuring day.
    
- **Reaction Timing with Drag Down:** If you choose to use **Drag Down** (the Graven Grip option that slams a knocked-up enemy down), you’ll typically do it _instead_ of using your Endemic Rupture reaction options. This uses your Bonus Action rather than Reaction, which interestingly **frees up your Reaction** for other things until the end of the round. In effect, Drag Down shifts the follow-up attack/heal into a Bonus Action and trades some damage for a **stronger condition** (prone + falling damage + potential stun). This is a good trade-off: the stun (if they fail Con) is powerful, so it costing your Bonus Action and two saving throws (Str then Con) feels fair. Also, because you “forgo the Reaction,” you could still have your Reaction later in the round (for an opportunity attack on a different enemy, for example). This is a neat bit of action economy tech – it encourages strategic thinking (do I want extra damage now, or do I want to potentially stun but use my Bonus Action and leave my Reaction open?). **No adjustments seem needed** here beyond clarifying the intent, as it’s a balanced choice for the player to make.
    

**Higher Levels:** By level 10 and 15, the subclass doesn’t add new competing action types (no new Reaction or Bonus features beyond what you have), it mainly **enhances existing abilities**:

- Level 10’s **Barren Exchange** improves the **Reaction** option _Siphon Anim_ (allowing two targets), but it doesn’t add a second Reaction. You still only ever get one Reaction per round. So action economy remains the same; you just get **more value** out of that one Reaction at level 10+. (Targeting two creatures with one Reaction is fine because it’s a single feature use.)
    
- Level 15’s **Weight of Death** is entirely passive bonuses (a damage aura, immunity to being moved/proned, and extra damage on grapples). These **do not consume any actions** – they just modify outcomes of things you’re already doing (grappling, standing your ground, etc.). So no action economy concern there.
    
- Level 18’s **Imaan Ascendance** is a **huge power** but costs one **Action** (and 1/long rest). It essentially kicks off a special battle scenario, but once active, combat actions proceed normally under the new rules. Importantly, using this does take your full Action that turn (like casting a powerful spell), so you wouldn’t be making attacks on the same turn – that’s a fair cost for such a game-changing effect. It doesn’t give you extra actions; it warps the battlefield instead. So while it’s powerful, it’s not overloading your action economy beyond that initial investment.
    

**Summary of Action Economy:** Overall, the subclass uses **every part of the action economy**: Actions (for big moves), Bonus Actions (for additional control at 7+), and Reactions (for follow-ups). This is great for an active, tactical playstyle, but it requires some **careful balancing**:

- At low levels, getting an Action+Reaction in one turn is strong, but the limitation on uses and need for a failed save keep it in check.
    
- By mid-levels, doing all three (Action+BA+Reaction) is possible in one round, but only by expending resources that are **limited per long rest**. This front-loads the fighter’s impact in a few key rounds rather than every round.
    
- It’s comparable to a Battlemaster fighter who might Action Surge and spend multiple superiority dice in one round – big nova rounds followed by calmer ones. The Deathground Fighter’s baseline round (when not using special features) will be more like a normal fighter (just with some extra damage from Crashing Blow or a prone enemy), so it’s really those feature-usage rounds that spike in complexity and power.
    

**Recommendation:** Be sure to playtest how a turn feels when the fighter unleashes **both Endemic Rupture and Graven Grip** in the same turn. If it ever feels too overwhelming at the table (for the player or DM), consider spacing them (e.g. Endemic Rupture could have been once per short rest instead, to reduce frequency, or Graven Grip as an Action instead of Bonus). **Currently, however, it looks manageable** given the campaign’s high-power nature, as long as everyone knows these combos use resources and can’t be done every single round.

## Damage Output and Scaling

Let’s evaluate the **damage numbers** at each stage and see if they’re balanced compared to standard fighter abilities. The goal is to ensure the subclass isn’t over or under-tuned in raw damage, considering it also brings control effects:

**Grounded Stance (Level 3) – _Crashing Blow & Kanabo Mastery_:** These give small damage boosts and crit benefits that scale with your base attacks:

- **Crashing Blow:** +1d4 bludgeoning damage whenever you hit a creature that is **prone or “knocked up.”** In tier 1 (levels 3–4), this is roughly +2.5 damage on a hit – a nice little bump, but only if you set up the condition. For comparison, the **Hunter’s Mark** spell at level 1 adds +1d6 (~3.5) to each hit, and many melee Rangers use that consistently. **Crashing Blow is a bit weaker per hit** than Hunter’s Mark, and you won’t have it on _every_ hit (only after you knock the enemy down or up). So this extra damage feels fair. It rewards you for playing into the subclass’s tactic (use your strength to prone or launch foes). As you level and make multiple attacks per round, this 1d4 per hit can add up, but it stays a modest bonus. For example, at level 11 a fighter has 3 attacks; if all are against a prone target, that’s an extra ~7.5 damage per round – significant but not game-breaking at that level (where enemies might have 100+ HP).
    
    - **Potential Adjustment:** If anything, some DMs allow that 1d4 to scale at later tiers (e.g. to 1d6 at level 10 or 11, 1d8 at level 15+) to keep it relevant. But given you add so many other damage sources later (grappling damage at 15, etc.), it’s **probably fine to leave as 1d4**. It ensures the subclass isn’t identified purely for its damage boost.
        
- **Kanabo Mastery (19–20 crit range vs controlled targets):** This is essentially the **Champion fighter’s Improved Critical**, but _conditional_. Champions get 19–20 crit on all attacks; you get it only against targets you’ve **grappled, knocked prone, or knocked up**. In practice, if you’re doing your thing, most tough enemies you focus on will end up in one of those states, so you’ll often benefit from the expanded crit range. It’s strong, but not absurd:
    
    - At level 3, critting on 19–20 doubles your crit chance from 5% to 10% (if the condition is met). This is nice with a big weapon (crits add dice), but it’s still luck-based and not guaranteed each fight.
        
    - Importantly, you **don’t have extra attack yet at 3**, so it’s only one swing per round that might crit. Champion fighters get this too at 3 and it’s considered a mild benefit overall.
        
    - As you level up, combining this with advantage (from enemies being prone or otherwise) can fish for crits more reliably. For example, by mid-levels you might grapple+shove a big foe, then unload attacks with advantage **and** 19–20 crit range. The math of crit fishing: with advantage and a 19–20 range, you have roughly a 19% chance to crit on each attack. That’s high, but that requires set-up each time (using some of your attacks to prone them first). It creates a high-risk/high-reward playstyle. We’d consider this balanced, since other subclasses like Samurai or Champion can achieve similar high crit scenarios (Samurai can get advantage at will, Champion has 18–20 range at level 15, etc.).
        
    - **No change needed** here; it fits the theme and is a fair trade-off (conditional for a benefit that another subclass gets unconditionally).
        

**Endemic Rupture (Level 3) – _Damage vs Battlemaster_:** Endemic Rupture’s damage has a few components:

- **Initial hit:** 1d8 + Strength mod bludgeoning if the target fails the STR save. (No damage on a success, presumably.) At level 3 with, say, +3 STR mod, that’s ~7 average damage. That’s about the same as a one-handed weapon hit, or a bit less than a greatsword hit. Not very high on its own.
    
- **Reaction follow-up:**
    
    - _Batting Blow:_ a full weapon attack (e.g. a maul 2d6+STR, ~10–12 damage on hit) **+** an extra 1d6 (3–4 damage) if you collide with another creature. So if you hit, that could be ~15 damage, plus a secondary target taking 1d6 (3 avg) and possibly falling prone. This is the highest-damage option but requires an attack roll and situational positioning (another enemy to collide with). Total potential from the whole Endemic+Batting sequence is roughly 1d8+1d6+weapon damage ≈ 20 damage on average if everything lands.
        
    - _Clamp and Crush:_ no direct damage on the reaction, just a grapple (with advantage on the check). This sacrifices damage for control. At level 3, grappling a foe you launched is mostly for style/control – and to set up that foe for you or an ally to whack next turn with advantage (if you then knock them prone). **This option actually reduces your damage output** in favor of battlefield control, which is a balancing factor. It’s good design that not every reaction choice is about stacking damage; some are strategic.
        
    - _Siphon Anim:_ deals 1d10 + STR necrotic (~8–9 avg) and heals you for half that (~4 hp). This plus the initial 1d8 means about 15 damage total and you heal ~4. Compared to Batting, it’s slightly less damage (and no second target hit), but you get some self-sustain. The healing at low levels is modest, but it can keep you going in a tight solo fight.
        

**Is this too much damage at level 3?** It’s front-loaded, but uses-per-day limit it. Consider a Level 3 Battlemaster as a benchmark:

- A Battlemaster could use a maneuver like **Trip Attack** on a hit: they deal weapon damage (~10) + 1d8 (~4.5) and potentially knock prone (STR save negates prone but not damage). If they Action Surge, they can do that twice in one round. They have 4 superiority dice per short rest.
    
- The Deathground fighter using Endemic Rupture (with Batting Blow) in one round might do ~20 damage and prone two enemies (primary knocked prone by collision Dex fail, secondary automatically prone from being hit by a flying body). But then they have used 1 of maybe 3 Endemic uses for the whole day.
    
- In **sustained fights**, the Battlemaster can often output more total damage (they can maneuver on several attacks, and still make a weapon attack as their action each turn). The Deathground fighter’s big combo replaces their usual Attack action for that turn – meaning if the save is **made by the enemy, you deal 0 damage** with your action. That swinginess is a built-in balancer.
    

Given these comparisons, the **damage at level 3-4 seems high but within acceptable bounds** for a nova and considering the resource constraints. The key is that it’s not every round; in rounds you don’t use Endemic Rupture, you’re just a fighter with a maul doing ~10 damage on a hit (plus maybe +1d4 if you managed to prone the target). That’s pretty normal.

**Scaling of Endemic Rupture:** Notably, the 1d8 and 1d10 damage dice **do not scale** as you level up. By the time you’re level 11+, an extra d8 is small potatoes. This is okay, because by then the feature’s primary purpose is **control** (launching and enabling your other abilities) rather than raw damage. Your weapon attacks will far outpace 1d8 damage. And at level 10, Siphon Anim can hit two targets (so 2×(1d10+STR) = roughly 18–20 damage total across two creatures, healing you for half of each). Even at high level, 2d10 extra damage in a round is nice but not huge; it’s the **rider effects** (healing, fear/taunt debuffs from Barren Exchange) that keep it relevant. This is a common design in 5e: a subclass feature might deal fixed damage, but its utility and secondary effects keep it worthwhile at higher levels.

- **Possible Concern:** If you find that at higher levels Endemic Rupture’s damage is too _weak_ to bother using (because a fighter’s multi-attack could simply deal more), you might consider a small scale-up. For example, some DMs might let the **launch damage** increase to 2d8 at level 11, 3d8 at level 17 (similar to cantrip scaling or Battlemaster superiority dice that go up to d10/d12). However, be cautious: increasing the damage makes the whole combo even more bursty. Since your campaign is high-powered anyway, it might not break anything, but it’s not strictly necessary. The feature is already mainly balanced around its control use.
    

**Graven Grip (Level 7) – _Damage and Stun:_** Graven Grip’s **Death Grip** option does no damage, just pulls and knocks prone. **Drag Down**, however, introduces falling damage and a stun chance:

- The falling damage is **1d6 per 5 feet fallen**. If you knocked someone 10 ft in the air with Endemic Rupture, Drag Down would slam them for 2d6 damage. If it was 15 ft, 3d6, etc. Typically, Endemic Rupture doesn’t specify how high the target is launched (“into the air” is vague), but it’s reasonable to assume about 10 feet up (since the reaction window implies they haven’t come down yet). So figure on **2d6 (~7 average)** damage from Drag Down, in addition to the 1d8 from launching them. That’s roughly equal to the Batting Blow’s collision damage approach.
    
- The big payoff of Drag Down is **potentially stunning the target** (Con save or stunned until end of your next turn). Stun is an extremely powerful condition – it denies the enemy their action and gives advantage to all attacks against them. Normally, only monks and a few high-level spells inflict stun like this. Your subclass gets it at 7, but with two caveats: **(1)** It requires two failed saves (Strength to get pulled down _and_ Con to be stunned), and **(2)** you must spend one of your limited Graven Grip uses _and_ have set the enemy up by knocking them into the air first. Considering those hurdles, it’s a fair trade.
    
    - _Comparative note:_ A 7th-level monk might use 2 Ki points in a round to Flurry and attempt two Stunning Strikes (two Con saves on two hits). The Deathground fighter might use one Endemic charge and one Graven Grip charge to similarly take an enemy out for a round. The resources are different (monk’s refresh on short rest, yours on long rest mostly), but the balance isn’t far off. If anything, the fighter’s stun combo deals more upfront damage, whereas the monk’s is attached to their regular attack damage. Both are strong in different ways.
        
- **No direct damage on pull:** We should note Death Grip (the pull to your feet) doesn’t deal damage even if the creature is yanked from a height. It just says if airborne, you slam them down _knocking them prone_, but no extra d6s. That’s fine – the prone itself is the benefit. If you wanted to be super granular, you could imagine a flying creature pulled 30 ft down taking some fall damage, but most DMs would treat “slam prone” as the effect and not stack additional falling damage beyond Drag Down’s explicit case. It’s likely a design choice to keep Death Grip purely about positioning/terrain control and Drag Down for damage+stun.
    

**Barren Exchange (Level 10) – _Siphon Anim Upgrade:_** At 10th level, the damage from **Siphon Anim** effectively **doubles**, since you can target two creatures. If two valid targets (grappled, prone, or knocked up and within 10 feet) are available, you deal **1d10+STR to each**. That could be ~9 damage to each (18 total) and you heal for half of each (so roughly 4+4 = 8 HP healed). In a chaotic melee with many foes, this is a strong swing – hurting two enemies and sustaining yourself. However, it’s still gated by the Reaction (so you do this instead of any other reaction that round) and by having set-up on those two enemies.

- This scaling is **appropriate**. At level 10, fighters getting multi-attack (3 attacks at level 11) means their baseline damage per round is high. A single 1d10 extra isn’t huge, so allowing it to hit two foes keeps the feature impactful. The added **debuffs** (fear or “taunt”) are short (one round) crowd-control effects that don’t stack damage but emphasize survivability (frightened enemies might not approach, taunted ones will focus you and have disadvantage if they swing at others). Those riders align with the subclass goal – controlling the battlefield and drawing aggro to the durable fighter. They are powerful in context but fleeting. A one-round **frighten** at level 10 is fine (many spells do much worse by that level), and a one-round **taunt** is essentially a limited mark (similar to the Cavalier’s mark ability, which imposes disadvantage if enemies attack others). So the numbers here (1d10 damage twice, short fear/taunt save) are balanced.
    
- **Self-Healing Total:** By level 10+, you might have STR 20, so Siphon Anim is 1d10+5 per target. If you hit two, and roll decently, you might heal on the order of 10 HP (half of ~20 total damage). This is a nice perk but not game-breaking; it’s on par with a fighter’s Second Wind (which at level 10 would heal 1d10+10 ~ average 15 once per short rest). You can do Siphon multiple times per long rest (as many Endemic uses as you have). If STR 20, you have 5 uses per long rest. If you devoted all of them to Siphon (and always had two targets, which is unlikely every time), you’d heal maybe ~50 HP _over the course of an adventuring day_. That’s roughly an extra Second Wind or two spread out – definitely **helpful for survivability**, but not enough to make you unkillable. So the healing/damage output is **reasonable**.
    

**Weight of Death (Level 15) – _Aura and Grapple Damage:_** At level 15, the subclass gets a moderate damage boost and mitigation via features:

- **Gravity Aura (10-ft):** Enemies in your 10-ft aura that are **forcibly moved** (pulled, pushed, launched) take damage equal to your STR mod. At level 15, STR mod is likely +5 (assuming 20 STR). This is a flat 5 damage whenever you or others shove someone around you. It’s a small automatic chip damage. It will mostly apply when _you_ use your own features (since you’ll be the one knocking enemies around), effectively adding +5 to things like Endemic Rupture’s launch or Graven Grip’s yank. For example, if you launch someone with Endemic Rupture while they’re in your aura, they’d take the 1d8+STR from Rupture plus 5 more from the aura. If you Batting Blow someone 15 ft, they took normal damage plus 5 (start in aura, then flung out). It’s minor, but adds up over a big brawl where multiple foes might be moving around. Importantly, this can only happen **once per forced movement instance**, and many enemies might not be moved at all in a round. So it’s situational. This 5 damage might apply to multiple enemies if, say, a spell pushes a bunch of them within your aura (each would take 5). But again, by level 15, dealing 5 automatic damage is not massive – it’s more of a flavor/flair effect to highlight your “weight” on the battlefield. No balance issues here; if anything, it’s a ribbon with occasional impact.
    
- **Grapple Damage:** When you **grapple a creature**, it immediately takes bludgeoning damage equal to your **weapon’s damage die + STR mod**. This effectively turns your grapple attempt into a kind of “mini-attack.” For example, with a maul (2d6 damage die) and STR 20, that’s 2d6+5 damage (avg ~12) dealt on a successful grapple. This is a significant buff to grappling, because normally grappling doesn’t harm the target, it just restrains their movement. Now you **aren’t sacrificing damage for a grapple** – you’re getting both. In fact, you could even argue it’s a bonus action-like effect folded into the Attack action: one of your attacks can both hurt and grab the foe.
    
    - Let’s compare: At level 15, a fighter usually has 3 attacks (Extra Attack (2) at 11, plus possibly hasted or something but let’s say 3 base). If all you did was swing your maul thrice, you’d deal ~3×(2d6+5) = ~3×12 = 36 damage on average in a round (not counting crits or other boosts). If you instead **grapple** as one of those attacks, under this feature you’d deal ~12 damage _and_ impose the grapple. Then you still have two attacks left to hit the now-grappled (and possibly prone) target for ~12 each. Total ~36 damage plus the target can’t move. So you basically lost nothing damage-wise by substituting a grapple for one attack. That is, indeed, a **straight upgrade** to your DPR (damage per round) when employing grapples. It encourages the intended playstyle (grab enemies!).
        
    - **Is it too much?** At 15th level, dealing ~12 damage is what one attack already does. So you haven’t exceeded typical fighter damage, you’ve just **shifted it** into a different kind of action. In fact, if you then _also_ shove the target prone (with another attack), that shove itself deals no damage – but you already dealt damage on the grapple, so across the two special attacks (grapple + shove) you dealt about the same as two normal hits (~12 for grapple, 0 for shove vs ~12+12 for two hits). The difference is now the target is prone and restrained from moving, giving you an advantage on the third attack (and your allies get advantages, etc.). This seems fair and actually necessary to ensure at high levels you’re not gimping your damage output by choosing to grapple. It keeps the subclass competitive.
        
    - If anything, one might argue this feature makes grappling strictly superior to a normal attack in many cases (because it does damage _and_ controls). But remember: Grapple checks use Athletics vs the target’s Athletics/Acrobatics, which sometimes is harder to succeed than an attack roll (depending on enemy). High-level monsters often have **Legendary Resistances or high Athletics/Acrobatics** (think of a dragon’s contest or a giant’s strength). You might fail the grapple attempt and then you’ve lost one of your three attacks with no damage to show. So it’s not automatic damage like an attack roll would be on a hit; it has a chance to fail. The guaranteed damage only happens _if you succeed_. In that sense, it’s balanced against a normal attack which might hit or miss.
        
    - **Two-handed weapon vs Grappling:** One thing to note (not exactly “damage” but related): To grapple, you need at least one free hand. Your subclass is clearly themed around a heavy two-handed weapon (kanabo/maul). So how do you grapple while wielding it? Typically, a fighter would have to **drop or stow** their weapon to grab someone. This could be a bit awkward in play: you might drop your kanabo (free object interaction) at your feet, use both hands to grab two enemies (if you try to grapple two targets in one turn using Extra Attack), and then perhaps kick your weapon up or pick it next round. Some DMs hand-wave this or allow you to hold the weapon in one hand for a moment (though a maul normally can’t be wielded in one hand effectively). Since you specifically call the weapon your “signature kanabo,” it might be worth a small note in the subclass description that the fighter has learned to **grapple even while holding their weapon** (perhaps slinging it momentarily or using it as leverage). It’s mostly a flavor concern, but addressing it can prevent table debates about “Do I need a free hand to grapple if my subclass is built for grappling?” Mechanically by rules, you _do_ need a hand free. So just keep it in mind. This isn’t a damage balance issue per se, but it affects how easily you can utilize that grapple damage feature.
        

**Imaan Ascendance (Level 18) – _Big Finish Damage:_** The capstone ability is more about battlefield control and narrative than raw damage, but it does have a **significant damage component**:

- Inside the **Imaan Plane**, the biggest direct buff to damage is “**Home-Ground Advantage**,” granting **advantage on all attacks** for allies of the declared taxon (presumably you and your allies if you chose your own lineage as the favored side). Advantage on every attack for up to 1 minute is huge – effectively a +5 to +10 boost to attack rolls and roughly +**~40%** more DPR for those attacks (because you crit more and miss less). However, this is essentially your **once-per-day ultimate**. It’s comparable to a wizard casting _Holy Weapon_ or _Tenser’s Transformation_ or a Cleric’s _Holy Aura_ – big 1-minute buffs you get at high level. Given the campaign goes beyond 20 and features “elden ring level grandeur,” this seems fitting. Just be aware that this arena effectively makes your party (or at least those sharing your taxon) way stronger for that fight. The balancing factor is that you likely will use it in a climactic encounter where the enemies are also very strong (possibly numerous). Also, the enemies _not_ of that taxon are stuck there to the death, so it’s literally a fight to the finish – a trade-off of risk vs reward.
    
- **Ancestral Echoes (auto-prone):** Each round, one non-taxon enemy that failed the initial save (there must be an initial save to resist being pulled into the Imaan Plane, though it’s not explicitly stated – presumably a Charisma or Wisdom save to not be yanked into a demiplane?) is knocked **prone** automatically. That adds some incidental damage potential because your allies have advantage (which they already did from the aura) and if you’re adjacent, your melee attacks get advantage (redundant with aura) – but also if an enemy is flying, getting knocked prone means they fall (possibly taking some fall damage). It’s more about ensuring at least one enemy is constantly on their back foot (literally). This further cements your superiority in the duel. It’s powerful, but at level 18+ it reads okay, especially since truly powerful foes might have ways to counter or just get back up on their turn (prone is strong but not as brutal as stun or paralyze).
    
- **Collapse – 6d10 bludgeoning:** When the effect ends, any surviving enemies (non-taxon) take a big hit: 6d10 (avg 33) bludgeoning, Dex save for half or avoid. Think of this like the arena itself dealing a finishing blow – it’s akin to a **6th-level spell’s worth of damage** (e.g. _Sunbeam_ or _Disintegrate_ do similar high damage). At level 18, 33 damage is noticeable but not crazy to a boss (it’s like one extra hit from a fighter). It might outright kill any low-level mooks that somehow survived the minute. It’s essentially a cherry on top to ensure foes who ran or tried to hide still get punished. Balanced in context, since again it’s only once per long rest.
    
- **Friendly Side Safety:** Allies of your taxon take no damage from the collapse. So you and your friends are safe. That’s just a narrative reward; no balance issue there.
    

**Overall Damage Output:** Across the subclass, the damage boosts tend to **offset the opportunity cost** of doing crowd-control. This is a key balancing philosophy: if a fighter spends attacks or actions to shove, grapple, or use special maneuvers, they often lose some damage output compared to just attacking. The Deathground features frequently **give damage in addition to control** (e.g. Crashing Blow adds damage when you knock prone, Weight of Death adds damage to grapples, etc.). This ensures the subclass can fulfill its role (locking down multiple enemies) **without falling behind in damage** relative to a straight “just attack” fighter.

From a pure DPR perspective, a Deathground Fighter who uses all options optimally might slightly **out-damage a Battlemaster or Champion** in niche situations (because of extra damage dice and critical hits). But in general:

- **Single-target DPR:** will be similar to a well-built Battlemaster. If the enemy can’t be knocked down or has legendary resistance, you’ll just be whacking it like any fighter.
    
- **Multi-target encounters:** your damage might actually shine more (spreading damage via collision, Siphon hitting two targets, etc.). But spreading damage isn’t always “better” since focusing one target is often ideal. You’re trading some focus-fire damage for **area influence**.
    

Given the campaign’s approach to balance (weaker subclasses get external buffs, etc.), it’s probably acceptable if this subclass does a bit more in its niche. Just keep an eye on any **unintended spikes**:

- For instance, **stacking feats** like **Great Weapon Master** (GWM) with advantage from prone and your crit-fishing could yield massive hits. A 19–20 crit range increases the frequency of GWM’s bonus action attack trigger (on crit or kill). In a 1v20 scenario, you might crit/kill something every round or two, triggering additional attacks. This isn’t inherently broken (that’s how GWM works for any fighter in a horde fight), but your subclass amplifies the conditions that enable it (easy crits, mobs of enemies). So expect a Deathground Fighter with GWM to sometimes do **very high burst damage** in crowds. That might be okay – it’s the fantasy of cutting through hordes on your last stand. But it’s worth noting in playtest to ensure it doesn’t steal the spotlight completely from other PCs.
    

## Resource Management and Frequency

The subclass mostly uses **long rest–limited resources**:

- **Endemic Rupture:** STR mod per long rest (usually 3–5 times a day by mid-levels).
    
- **Graven Grip:** Prof. bonus per long rest (3 times at L7, up to 6 at L17+).
    
- **Imaan Ascendance:** 1 per long rest.
    

This means the Deathground Fighter has a pool of special moves they can pull out in key fights or moments, rather than every single encounter. In a long adventuring day with multiple encounters, they’ll have to budget these abilities.

For example, if there are, say, four combats in a day, the fighter can’t go all-out in each one:

- They might use Endemic Rupture in 3 of them (if STR 18, mod +4) and be out of uses in a final battle if not careful.
    
- Graven Grip maybe 3 times total, which could all be used in one big fight or spread out.
    

This is similar to how a Battlemaster manages superiority dice or a spellcaster manages spell slots. It’s a bit unusual for a fighter to be that resource-dependent (most fighter abilities recharge on short rest or are at-will tactics), but it’s not a bad thing. It actually reins in their nova potential across the whole day.

**Possible Adjustment – Short Rest Recharge:** If you find in play that the fighter either:

- **A:** Blows all their tricks in one fight and feels like a “lion” in the first fight and a “lamb” in the second, or
    
- **B:** Is hesitant to ever use their cool features because they fear not having them later,
    

you might consider allowing **one of the features to recharge on a short rest**. For example, making Endemic Rupture uses refresh on a short rest (like Battlemaster dice do) could let the fighter use it more freely. This would _increase_ their overall daily power, though, so only do this if the campaign pacing supports it (lots of short rests, lots of encounters). The **balance so far is okay** if most fights are big set-piece battles where the fighter is expected to unleash everything. In a campaign with fewer but epic encounters, per-long-rest is fine.

**External Balancing:** As you noted, weaker subclasses are propped up by items or other boons, so if the Deathground Fighter ends up a tad stronger baseline, that’s acceptable. The DM can always give slightly less potent magic items to the fighter or throw slightly tougher mobs at him to compensate, if needed. Conversely, if somehow this subclass underperforms in play (for instance, if every enemy has high Strength and keeps making the saves, nullifying a lot of your kit), the DM might introduce items that impose **disadvantage on enemy Str/Dex saves** or increase the fighter’s Strength beyond 20 to raise the DC. There are knobs to turn.

## Overall Balance and Playstyle Feedback

**Strengths of the Subclass:** It clearly excels in scenarios where the fighter is **surrounded or outnumbered**, just as intended. The toolkit (prone, grapple, area denial, self-healing, fear/taunt, etc.) makes them a **controller/tank** on par with some spellcasters in terms of battlefield shaping. They can lock down big threats (even Huge creatures, thanks to counting as larger) and punish hordes of smaller ones (with collisions and the final arena power). Importantly, they can do this while still dealing solid damage. Many control-focused characters sacrifice damage (e.g. a pure Protection Cavalier or a Control Wizard), but the Deathground Fighter balances both roles by design.

**Potential Weaknesses:** It’s worth noting that the subclass’s efficacy can be swingy:

- **Save Reliance:** Many of your big moves rely on enemy failed saves (Strength save for Rupture and Graven Grip, Con save to stick the stun, Dex saves for collision/prone and the final arena collapse, Wis saves for fear). If you face creatures with great saves or legendary resistances, some of these tools won’t land. For example, a high-level **dragon** (proverbial test case) has legendary resistance, excellent Strength and Con – it might resist being launched or stunned. You _can_ still grapple and shove it prone (because of Immovable Mass letting you grapple Huge monsters, which is awesome and unique!), but the saves for magical effects might often succeed. This is fine because it gives the fighter something to sweat over instead of trivializing every boss. Just keep in mind: in those cases, your damage output reverts to “just a fighter with a big stick” (albeit with crit synergy).
    
    - That said, being able to wrestle a dragon to the ground at all is a _huge narrative win_! Expect those moments to feel epic. Just be ready for DMs to perhaps give legendary creatures a way to shake off a grapple or stand up with half movement (they always can stand with movement, no save needed to end prone on their turn). So bosses will still pose a challenge.
        
- **Team Dynamics:** Because you shine when outnumbered, you might _intentionally seek out_ positions where you’re surrounded. Ensure the player (if it’s not you) and DM are on the same page about the fighter being a durable focal point of enemy attention. The subclass encourages a kind of “anchor” playstyle (Sun Tzu Deathground – fight with back to a wall, no retreat). This likely means the fighter should have strong defenses (high AC from armor, or lots of HP). As a DM, one might throw the fighter a bone by giving them a defensive item or allowing a little higher point-buy for Con, etc., so they can survive being focus-fired by multiple enemies. The subclass does give some tools (taunt to draw attacks, self-heal, temp HP at 18), but between level 3–17, their durability is just like any fighter’s – which is good but not invincible. In a 1v5 scenario, a lone fighter can still get whittled down fast if the dice turn against them. So **watch the durability** in playtests. If they seem to be getting KOd when attempting the heroic 1vX stand, you might scale back enemy damage or bump the fighter’s protection a bit. Conversely, if they’re untouchable (maybe the Owlbear race has extra toughness?), then it’s fine.
    
- **Owlbear Race Synergy:** You mentioned a homebrew Owlbear race for a player using this subclass. Depending on what traits that race has, synergy could amplify the subclass:
    
    - If the Owlbear race is Large or has Powerful Build, it might stack with **Immovable Mass** (though Powerful Build usually affects carry capacity, not grappling size – but if it did, a Large owlbear counting as Huge for grapples is crazy – he could grapple gargantuan creatures!). Probably it just means a Medium Owlbear with Powerful Build still counts as Large for lifting, which combined with Immovable Mass would count as Huge for grappling. That’s something to be aware of: your fighter might be able to grab **truly massive foes**. Balance-wise, grappling something three sizes larger might break verisimilitude, but if it’s epic fantasy and the DM approves, go for it. Mechanically, it’s mostly about preventing escape (most Huge+ monsters still can attack while grappled, you’re not shutting down their offense, just limiting movement).
        
    - If the race has natural weapons or claws, the fighter could still fight while grappling (e.g., hold a foe and claw them). That could make **Clamp and Crush** option more appealing (grapple mid-air, then claw attack next round). This is fine – actually a cool visual – but track the damage to ensure it doesn’t double-stack unfairly. (Using a grapple to set up free advantage claw attacks is the intent, so it should be fine.)
        
    - If the Owlbear has a feature like a **grappling advantage** (some races or feats grant advantage on Athletics checks to grapple) or extra reach, that further cements this combo. It will make the fighter very reliable at executing their moves. That means fewer instances of “wasted action because enemy saved/contested,” which _raises the average power_ of the subclass. It’s not inherently bad, just something to keep in mind. An Owlbear Deathground fighter could be a monster on the battlefield (literally and figuratively!). Likely your campaign has similarly powerful options for others.
        

**Final Thoughts:** You’ve crafted a subclass with a strong identity and dynamic playstyle. The **action economy** usage is on the heavy side (lots of things to do/track, especially at levels 3 and 7 when new options appear), but each has an appropriate cost and limit. Nothing jumps out as completely busting the economy – the Reaction usage is probably the most notable, and we’ve determined it parallels things like Battlemaster’s Reaction maneuvers or a Cavalier’s marking attacks, just used proactively.

In terms of **numbers**, the subclass’s damage additions and DCs seem **balanced for a high-powered game**. The damage boosts compensate for doing tactical moves, and the control effects shine in the intended scenarios. The DC for all your saves is 8 + prof + STR, which will start around 13–14 at level 3 (assuming STR 16–17) and scale to maybe DC 19 or 20 by level 17 (STR 20, prof +6). High-level monsters often have +10 or more on saves, so expect about a 50/50 success at best on those. Lower-level mooks will fail more often, which is perfect (you toss them around like ragdolls). This scaling is standard and **doesn’t need adjustment** unless you notice everything failing or succeeding too often in play.

**No Ability Changes Needed (for now):** Since you asked not to change abilities outright, I haven’t suggested removing anything. All features as written can work – it’s mostly a matter of tuning **damage dice or frequency** if needed:

- If during playtesting you find a particular damage number consistently too high or low, you can tweak the die size (e.g. Batting Blow collision 1d6 could become 1d4 if it’s too much in a big crowd, or Endemic’s 1d8 to 2d6 if it’s too little at high level, etc.). But initially, it’s wise to run with these values; they seem within acceptable ranges.
    
- Keep an eye on **stun** at level 7. If the party has other strong stuns, multiple stuns can trivialize encounters. But since yours is limited and gated by saves, it’ll likely be fine.
    
- The **Imaan Ascendance** is a spectacular capstone. The only balancing consideration there is clarity on the “taxon” mechanics (to ensure the right side gets the advantage – presumably you want _your_ side to have it!). Mechanically, it’s powerful but fitting for a one-time 18th-level ability. The damage from it (6d10 collapse, etc.) is big but appropriate.
    

In summary, **Deathground** is shaping up to be a powerful subclass, but given your campaign context, it doesn’t outright break 5e’s combat economy or damage benchmarks. It _will_ feel strong in its niche (as it should). The main feedback is to maintain clarity in the rules (especially around using Reaction vs Bonus in the same knock-up sequence) and to playtest those intense combo-turns to ensure they feel epic but not confusing.

Feel free to follow up with specific adjustments you’re considering – we can then fine-tune the numbers or wording as needed based on this analysis. The foundation here is solid; now it’s about dialing it in so that the subclass is **enjoyable for the player and balanced for the table**.
