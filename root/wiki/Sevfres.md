# Sevfres
_Exhuma ([[Tildohsi Partition]])_
<img src="wiki_images/Sevfres.png"></img>

**Sevfres**, locally known as Exhuma, is a powerful and enigmatic entity bound within the depths of the [[Clutched Forest]]. A [[Decara|Decaran]] [[Huma]] [[Mimid]], Sevfres was trapped in the forest through a sacrificial [[Source Surge]]. The people of [[Tildohsi]] and the [[Tildohsi Partition]] have survived in the shadow of Sevfres by mastering deception and sound-masking magic, using these techniques to hide from the hand’s relentless search. While Sevfres is a constant threat, its presence also provides a form of indirect protection for the city, as its power deters outside invaders.

## Main Section

**Sevfres** is a being of immense destructive power, its form manifesting as a hand and a portion of a wrist, forever seeking and grasping within the forest. The entity’s origins are rooted in the ancient history of the Decara, a kingdom of destructive force within the [[Toman Ecoss]]. Sevfres is said to have been bound to the Clutched Forest through a sacrificial act that resulted in an unending determination to kill.

The survival of [[Tildohsi]] and the [[Tildohsi Partition]] depends on their ability to avoid Sevfres’s attention. They employ advanced sound-masking magic and attention-baiting techniques to keep the hand occupied in certain areas, allowing their city to remain hidden. Members of the Partition known as [[Pincher]]s have developed the ability to control Sevfres’s attacks, using sound magic to direct its destructive force against their enemies. This tactic proved decisive during the battle against the [[Chain of Delta]], where Sevfres destroyed 212 [[Willed-Mecha]], allowing the Partition to claim valuable resources.

Sevfres’s connection to sound and voice magic is profound, and it is also linked to entities such as [[Chunk]] and the [[Lost Bank]]. The hand’s presence is both a curse and a shield, shaping the culture, magic, and survival strategies of those who live in the Clutched Forest. The people of Tildohsi have learned to coexist with Sevfres, turning its threat into a tool for their own protection and advancement.
