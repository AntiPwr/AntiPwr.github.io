Sol Unita is the ruling class of [[Asceptim]], originally known as [[Scender Unita]] during the early years of the [[Line from Few]]. Deeply rooted in faith, scientific progress, and structured governance, Sol Unita prioritizes the technological and spiritual ascension of its people. The capital order of [[Scender]] stands as the heart of this belief system, embodying the principles of Sol Unita’s rule.

## Governance and the Royal Sancts

Sol Unita is ruled by four royal Sancts, each with a distinct philosophy on ascension and governance. These families serve as the foundation for both religious doctrine and state administration.

- [[Ballast Sanct]] – The largest and most influential Sanct, Ballast holds that ascension is only for true believers. Their funding and religious influence helped establish the [[Asath Sanctuary]] and fortify Southcatch.
- [[Necesse Sanct]] – Emphasizing free will, Necesse believes ascension is an individual pursuit. Queen [[Ophelia Necesse]] belongs to this Sanct, having married into it, but reinterprets the idea of individual pursuit to mean that one person must guide the collecttive to [[Sol Proscima]].
- [[Dianett Sanct]] – Focused on genetic perfection, Dianett maintains that ascension is determined by bloodline rather innovation. 
- [[Hiamoe Sanct]] – The smallest Sanct politically, Hiamoe believes ascension is a random occurrence, with society’s role being to simply wait and endure. They are the most open to outsiders and control large eastern sections of Southcatch, namely the [[Out and Inn]], [[Livilla]], multiple [[hospit garden|hospit gardens]], as well as farmlands just outside of Scender.

These four families shape Sol Unita’s policies, societal structure, and religious progression. The Queen of Scender, despite being rooted in a royal sanct, serves a role of intercommunicator to ensure constant progress towards Sol Proscima.

## Economy and the Sunstream

Sol Unita’s economic system operates under [[Sunstream]], a government-controlled flow of resources designed to maximize efficiency and support monopolistic industry development. This results in a natural monopoly system, where the most successful enterprises thrive while smaller ones adapt into subsidiary roles.

- The Ascension Band of [[Scender]] serves as the commercial hub, where only the best businesses maintain a presence.
- Large industries such as clothing, agriculture, and research are given designated land and government benefits.
- Government employees, often considered state assets, may be transferred between departments or relocated as needed.

Citizenship practically guarantees financial stability, but achieving citizenship is highly difficult. Non-citizens who live in Southcatch must provide a vital service or contribution to remain in Sol Unita’s jurisdiction.

The [[Bank of Scender]] oversees The Sunstream, employing [[Floaters]]—analysts responsible for monitoring businesses, enforcing regulations, and scouting for economic inefficiencies. These inspector-like agents determine the fate of smaller businesses and startup enterprises.

## Religious Doctrine and Law

Faith and law are inseparable in Sol Unita. All [[Huma]] are expected to follow Asceptim principles, and other faiths are tolerated but not permitted to take residence within Scender Proper—only in Southcatch.

The [[Rites of Huma]] serve as the moral and legal foundation of Sol Unita:

- [[Rite of Passage]] – The foundation of faith, dictating that ascension is the ultimate goal of all Huma.
- [[Rite of Rule]] – Positions of power must be earned through deep understanding of those governed.
- [[Rite of Recomposition]] – Encourages technological adaptation to fulfill decomposition, voiding the Empire Function of [[Celia]].
- [[Rite of Egress]] – One should never return to past suffering; governs refugee and exile policies.
- [[Rite of Transference]] – Power transfers upon signs of enlightenment, ensuring that governance remains progressive.

Sol Unita maintains strict anti-Celia laws, justifying this policy through propaganda linking Celia to the legacy of [[Alwa]]. In truth, Celia's ability to consume corpses disrupts the production of [[Hollow Resource|Hollow Resources]], a vital material in Sol Unita’s economy.

## Military and Law Enforcement

Sol Unita’s military and policing force is symbiotic, integrating [[Ferra]], [[Bluma]], and [[Natura]] into enforcement operations.

- Herd-policing forces composed of trained Ferra operate in packs and swarms, pursuing lawbreakers under conditioned training.
- Reservoir, Sol Unita’s military, acts as backup for the Guards and is deployed in greater national defense efforts.
- Guards are selected based on sacrifice and connection to Asath. They receive extensive privileges and benefits but also take on high-risk responsibilities.

## The Solscept and Future Infrastructure

The [[Solscept]], located at the heart of Scender, is Sol Unita’s largest and most ambitious research project. It is gradually being developed as a pillar upon which Scender will be enclosed in [[Sar Glass]], an attempt to create an impenetrable dome over the city. This long-term project, initiated by Ophelia Necesse’s predecessor, is designed to shield Scender from tectonic damage caused by the next proposed [[Gyre Shift]].

- The Solscept is encircled by the [[School of Coveri]], providing education tied to Sol Unita’s religious framework.
- Government-funded engineering projects prioritize infrastructure longevity, ensuring self-sufficiency for centuries to come.

This project embodies Sol Unita’s long-term vision, ensuring that faith and science will stand the test of time.

## Cultural Perspectives and Social Integration

- Technohumanism, or [[Tekyume]], a movement blending technological and human ascension, is gaining popularity, particularly in Scender Proper.
- Scender’s society, under Ophelia Necesse, holds death in a positive light, seeing it as necessary for ascension rather than a tragedy, which was the case under the guidance of Sancts in the past.
- Apprenticeship is the backbone of the workforce, with government-backed job placement ensuring artisans, scholars, and innovators thrive.

For those seeking asylum, Sol Unita extends a hand—but only for a limited time. The [[Asath Sanctuary]] offers structured religious programs to refugees, with one week to prove their need for sanctuary. If they fail, they are relocated to neighboring towns with access to social integration programs, work placements, and education, but not granted citizenship or entry into Scender Proper.
