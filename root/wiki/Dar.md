**Bin**: [[Scape]]  
**Basin**: [[Sacrus]]  
**Eco**: [[Dar]] of [[Toman Ecoss]]

**Dar** is a dark and enigmatic [[Imaan Plane]] [[Eco]] within the [[Toman Ecoss]], known for its labyrinthine tunnels and the pervasive presence of the [[Decara]] [[Kingdom]]. Constructed using half of the plane of [[Scape (TTRPG)/1 Purpose Taxonomy/Complete Taxonomy/02 Eco/01 Toman Ecoss/02 Toma/Toma]], Dar serves as the domain of [[Gorisain]], the god of destruction and decay, embodying the chaos and malevolence that pervades this realm.

#### Origin and Structure

Dar was formed during the [[Natural War]], a period of intense conflict and transformation that reshaped Toma's landscape. The realm was not built anew but was crafted from the existing terrain of Toma. It emerged from the primordial chaos of the [[Two Virus Mythos]], where Gorisain eliminated the rival bacteria and solidified his dominance by usurping the power of creation from [[Desthema]].

Desthemaâ€™s body and her followers were obliterated to create Dar. Gorisain transferred his followers into his body and brought them into the newly formed plane. Desthema's soul, unable to reach the [[Soul Well]], remained trapped within Dar. This led to the formation of a unique strain of Therium called [[Desthema's Heart]], a rare node deep within the [[Summons Mountain Range]]. This node contains Desthema's soul, surrounded by her followers' Spira (Therium) to keep it alive. If discovered, it could release Desthema's soul into the gradient, corrupting a soul and revealing the Carrion.

#### Geography and Environment

Dar is a vast underground network of tunnels and caverns, characterized by its perpetual darkness. The landscape is ever-changing, molded by the consumption of Decaran biowaste and the infusion of anima. The terrain itself is alive, known as Gorrbis, which adapts and evolves in response to the creatures that inhabit it.

- **Darkness and Light**: The absence of direct sunlight in Dar creates an eerie and oppressive atmosphere. The only light comes from [[Bluthrut]], a plant with clear vein-like roots that provide illumination and nourishment from recycled Decaran waste.

- **Gorrbis and Adaptation**: The living terrain of Gorrbis is influenced by the anima released from consumed corpses, shaping the minds and motives of newborn Decara. This adaptation ensures that the Decara remain formidable and resourceful in their pursuit of destruction.


#### Cultural Practices

The Decara in Dar are deeply entrenched in rituals and practices that reflect their devotion to Gorisain and their desire for ascension.

- **Ritualistic Feasting**: A central aspect of Decaran culture, ritualistic feasting involves the consumption of living creatures and corpses. This practice is believed to enhance the Decara's connection to Gorisain and influence their evolution.

- **Decaran Tunnels**: The tunnels of Dar are considered sacred extensions of Gorisain's body. These passageways serve as places of worship and connection to the deity's consciousness in the [[Soul Fields]].


#### Domains and Influence

Gorisain's presence in Dar governs the domains of suffering, bacteria, death, sin, pestilence, murder, and massacre. His influence shapes the destructive tendencies of the Decara, driving their relentless pursuit of power and control.

#### Legacy and Significance

Dar is a testament to the destructive potential within the Toman Ecoss, serving as a constant reminder of the chaos and decay that can arise from unchecked ambition and power. Its existence is a reflection of Gorisain's legacy, influencing the evolution and dynamics of the kingdoms within Toma and symbolizing the unnatural balance caused by the dominance of a single entity over the Decara.
