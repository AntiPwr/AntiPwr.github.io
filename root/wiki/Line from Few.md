(Since getting medicated)

As the continents were replenished, few orders remained. The [[Scepitath]], now Sol Unita, reclaimed the surface region and named it "[[Sancta]]". The [[Esterik]], now the Branches of Concordia, claimed Concordia. The Chain of Delta remained atop the surface throughout the Cel Blindbirth Line and did not face the population loss. As a result, they are much more powerful than all other societies except for Dar.
