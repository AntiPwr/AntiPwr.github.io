Mycelism is the phylum and way of life for the Celia kingdom, resulting from Chantae's hivemind. It is considered a religion by some, though this is controversial. Mycelism teaches that Celia act only by Chantae's will, have no free will, and that decay and rebirth are the core of existence. Ritual rebirth and the cycle of life are central beliefs.
