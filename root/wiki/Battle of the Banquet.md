**Eco**: [[Scape (TTRPG)/1 Purpose Taxonomy/Complete Taxonomy/02 Eco/01 Toman Ecoss/02 Toma/Toma]] ([[Babadoo Slim]]) of [[Toman Ecoss]]  
**Kingdom**: [[Huma]]  
**Phylum**: [[Pria]] and [[Ashprahm]]
**Class**: [[Tayim Trade Republic]]
**Order**: [[Old Badaba]] (now [[New Badaba]])

The **Battle of the Banquet** was a turning point in the history of [[Babadoo Slim]], representing the overthrow of the [[Tayim Trade Republic]]'s stronghold, [[Old Badaba]], by the native inhabitants and Tayim dissidents who had shifted ideologically towards [[Primalism and Advancism|Advancism]] and embraced the belief system of **[[Gludestit]]**, largely due to the island’s growing trade in exotic **[[Primordial]]** creatures. This evolved into the belief of [[Pria]]. This battle was not just a clash of arms but a pivotal moment in the ideological and ecological reshaping of the region.

### Prelude to the Battle

Old Badaba had been an imperial settlement designed to expand the influence of the [[Ashprahm]] faith and provide an agricultural hub for the impoverished lower classes of the Tayim Trade Republic. Over the course of two generations, however, the local populace—both natives and disillusioned Tayim settlers—began to resist the rigid structures of Ashprahm and the exploitative practices of the Republic. Advancism, with its ideals of technological progress and connection to the primal forces of nature through Gludestit, became a unifying ideology. This led to growing tensions between the ruling class and the rebellious factions that would ultimately spark the Battle of the Banquet.

### The Battle

The Battle of the Banquet began as an uprising against the Republic’s infrastructure in Old Badaba. The Tayim and native Advancists, emboldened by their rejection of Ashprahm, rose up and destroyed much of the city’s physical and spiritual foundations. The Republic’s infrastructure, built to support both its imperialist goals and agricultural production, was methodically dismantled in the rebellion.

During this battle, the devastation extended beyond human lives, claiming the island’s rich ecosystems. [[Bluma]] and [[Ferra]] were caught in the crossfire, resulting in a massive death toll among both people and nature. As these creatures fell, they triggered the rise of **[[Celia]]**, fungal entities associated with rebirth and decomposition, which appeared from the rich, now blood-soaked soils of Babadoo Slim.

### Inertia Decision and the Celia Uprising

The Tayim forces, frightened by the sudden appearance of Celia, made the fateful **Inertia Decision**—an instinctive and ill-considered choice to attack the Celia, despite their peaceful nature. This decision, motivated by fear and misunderstanding, resulted in the slaughter of thousands more, as the Celia retaliated to protect themselves. The battle devolved into chaos, With only a small percentage of the survivors making it back to [[Tayim]] to tell the tale.

Although the Tayim initially seemed to have won the battle, their decision to engage the Celia cost them dearly. The Celia, unharmed by the human aggression, revitalized the land through their decomposition and rebirth cycles. The soils of Babadoo Slim were enriched by the death that had occurred, allowing the region to rebound as a fertile agricultural hub, providing the foundation for [[New Badaba]]'s future prosperity.

### The Banquet

The term Banquet refers to the feast that symbolized the Celia’s dominance and revitalization of the region. After the [[Huma]] destruction, the Celia "feasted" upon the death and decay that covered the land, transforming it into a thriving, fertile environment. The feast also came to represent the critical moment when nature reclaimed its sovereignty over the island, healing the land in a way that human governance could not.

Although the Tayim Republic had superficially won the battle, their aggressive decisions, particularly the attack on the Celia, led to their eventual downfall. The agricultural resurgence brought about by the Celia, alongside the ideological shift in the survivors, allowed New Badaba to rise from the ashes of the old city.

### Aftermath and Legacy

The Battle of the Banquet left Old Badaba in ruins, but from this devastation emerged a new order. New Badaba, governed by the [[Hacienda Band]], was founded east of the remnants of the old city. Its culture and beliefs diverged significantly from the Tayim Trade Republic, embracing the [[Pria]] belief system, which venerated the cycle of life, death, and rebirth, epitomized by the Celia, while also breeding greed and advancist belief.

The decision to engage the Celia has become a moral and cultural lesson for the people of New Badaba. The Pria belief system, which is dominant on Babadoo Slim today, advocates for nurturing the land and its creatures, even through purposeful death and sacrifice, to feed the natural forces that sustain life. The Celia, in turn, are seen as divine agents of this balance, and their continued influence over the region is considered a vital part of its prosperity.

### Inspiration

The Battle of the Banquet draws inspiration from historical clashes where native populations and colonists fought for control over land and resources, often with catastrophic consequences. It reflects the ecological disasters and spiritual upheavals that can arise when imperial powers push too far, only to be undone by the forces of nature. The Celia’s role in the battle is reminiscent of mythological and religious beliefs surrounding death and rebirth, where nature itself takes revenge on those who seek to dominate it.
