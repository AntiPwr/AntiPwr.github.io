Coveri, SC Uni,

"The hidden success of Scender is the open source, free-flowing education system, the true backbone of their advancing society and faith. With each class taken, you chisel at node of purpose,

build upon the stream of information you enjoy

this can only exist so long as hope remains necessary."

The

School of Coveri

 does not work like regular universities with student schedules. Instead, lectures and presentations are held randomly based on what professors and teachers are in Scender and willing to teach. These classes are posted two weeks prior to their date and can be joined any time before it begins, so long as there is space.
 The school also holds classes in Solscept.
