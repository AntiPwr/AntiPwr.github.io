**Ester Slates** are belief-imbued [[Corlin Tree|Corlin]] [[Photometal]], crystal, and stone panels surrounded in an antimagic rock slate casing. The intricate design of the casing restricts the Photometal to only interacting with one belief pool at a time. The casing allows photometal to transfer one creature's belief to another's mind, with the latter perceiving it as if it were there own. This is akin to reliving the experience of another person. This can cause [[Slate Sickness]].
