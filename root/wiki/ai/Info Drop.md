# Source Surges

*“Human beings are poor examiners, subject to superstition, bias, prejudice, and a PROFOUND tendency to see what they want to see rather than what is really there."* - **Scott M. Peck**

The Source Surge System consists of two main components: Passive Surges and Controlled Surges.

Passive Surges

A Passive Surge is an event that occurs naturally within the [[Toman Ecoss]] without direct control from individuals. These surges are manifestations of powerful and overlapping belief spheres, influenced by entities such as [[Nesa]] or religious [[Order]]s. Passive Surges can be used at the discretion of the DM to enhance storytelling and create dynamic interactions.

- **Perception of Delusions**: In areas with strong overlapping belief spheres, creatures may perceive delusions as small passive surges of connection, contributing to the existence of [[False Nesa]].
- **Druid's Grief**: A druid's tears over a fallen creature might cause roots to sprout from the ground.
- **Weight Lifted**: A fighter encountering their enemy may feel a surge of energy, shedding exhaustion.
- **Celebration of the Champion**: The return of a celebrated hero might inspire a spontaneous village celebration.

Controlled Surges

Controlled Surges are the second component of the Source Surge System. They allow players to channel their beliefs actively, drawing upon all filled Claim Boxes that represent different aspects of their character's convictions. By activating a Controlled Surge, players invoke a powerful belief event that encompasses the entirety of their character's belief system.

Claim Boxes

Characters fill out Claim Boxes on their character sheets, representing their beliefs and values:

1. **Faith Box**: Deity, religion, or leader your character worships.
2. **Virtue Box**: Core virtue or moral principle your character holds dearest.
3. **Purpose Box**: Overarching goal or purpose in life.
4. **Oath Box**: An oath or promise made by your character.
5. **Connection Box**: An important relationship or bond your character has.

(Optional Rule) Claim Boxes may be hidden until discovered or attuned to during gameplay, providing a sense of progression and exploration.

Activating a Controlled Surge

As an action, players can activate a Controlled Surge by selecting all their filled Claim Boxes. The power and effect should reflect the combined emotional impact and context of the roleplay moment.

**Example:**

- **Faith Box**: Scendilism
- **Virtue Box**: Justice
- **Purpose Box**: To avenge my fallen family
- **Oath Box**: I will protect the weak
- **Connection Box**: My bond with my party.

Activating a Controlled Surge invokes a belief event that encompasses all these aspects, granting the character an extraordinary boost in power or insight, reflecting their deepest convictions and motivations.

Forming an Avatar of Belief

Upon filling all Claim Boxes, players have the opportunity to collaborate with the DM to create an avatar of their belief. This avatar embodies the essence of the character's beliefs and serves as a manifestation of their spiritual power. The avatar can take various forms, depending on the player's beliefs, and offers unique abilities and enhancements during a Controlled Surge.

Restorative Meditation

After a surge, characters must undergo reflection and restoration through extended rest or focused meditation to harness their beliefs effectively again.

Extended Rest

A minimum of one week of rest restores a character's ability to activate claims, allowing recovery from mental and emotional exertion.

Meditative Practices

Characters can expedite recovery through daily meditation, engaging in practices like prayer, mental exercises, and rituals. Each two-hour meditation session reduces the cooldown by one day.

Role-Playing Meditation

Players should vividly describe their character's meditation practices, environment, and internal reflections, enhancing narrative depth and personal growth.

Deathground as a belief event. Spira should connect heavily to this.










# Source Surge Types

**Bin**: [[Scape]]  
**Basin**: [[Sacrus]]
**Eco**: [[Toman Ecoss]]

Surges, or belief events, are phenomena in the [[Toman Ecoss]] that signify the plane's approach to [[Soul Imaa]]. These events arise from a surge of stored anima due to an extremism of belief, often occurring during pivotal moments in a creature's life or through a manual process described in the [[Merchant System]]. During a belief event, a creature's core is rapidly exposed to an abnormal amount of anima as their [[Belief Pool]] experiences a dramatic increase in potency and size. This can lead to changes in the environment or self, depending on the [[Belief Pool]] composition. The anima is drawn from the [[Soul Fields]], as [[Spira]] and/or [[Nesa]] feed from the pool ravenously.

Surges can be categorized into two main types:

- **Passive Surges**: These occur naturally and are not directly controlled by the individual. They can manifest spontaneously in response to powerful [[Belief Pool]]s or significant events. Examples include sudden changes in the environment or unintentional displays of power.
  
- **Controlled Surges**: These are deliberate and can be activated by the individual, often as a result of focused or intense emotional states. Controlled surges are often tied to the [[Merchant System]], where belief and conviction are harnessed to produce specific outcomes.

In the broader context of the [[Scape]], surges are achieved by building upon lower dimensions to reach a higher one, aligning with the foundational structure of existence. This concept is integral to [[Purpose Taxonomy]], which is based on belief.



# Toman Surges

Ascension

Ascension is the process by which a soul rises to a higher state of existence, specifically to a higher [[Basin]] within the [[Scape]]. This elevation signifies transcending current limitations and accessing greater knowledge, power, and understanding. Ascension is the ultimate goal for many belief-driven individuals and groups, representing the culmination of spiritual growth and enlightenment.

Known Ascendants

- [[Alwa]]

Nascension

Nascension occurs when a creature is transferred to the Soul Fields and transformed into a Nesa.

Link

An anomaly event creates a [[Waterway]] or link within the Scape, with vast capabilities.

Imaan Ascendance

This event alters and expands the In-between. There are two types:

- **Idolation**  
    Causes a Nesa to be seen as an Avatar.
    
- **Reformation**  
    [[Reflection]]  
    Creates an [[Imaan Plane|Imaan Line]] through the fabric of the In-between due to overwhelming agreement or conviction in [[Belief Pool]]s or belief system.
    

Surge Traits

Surges have core identifying traits:

Desire

Surges arising from desire appear in varying hues of red.

Faith

Surges arising from faith appear in varying hues of yellow.

Knowledge

Surges arising from perceptual understanding appear in varying hues of blue.

Sundry

Surges arising from a mix of the previously mentioned motives appear in blended hues.

Connection

A combined surge from two or more co-occurring surges by creatures with similar or complementary beliefs. The colors and values of the belief event appear separate near the individuals and combine through a spatial connection.

Scale of Morality

The Scale of Morality measures a belief event's morality, as perceived by the Goda. Events display lighter or darker hues, representing good and evil. The Scale of Morality is a source of significant political and religious conflict on the plane, based on various interpretations of this natural phenomenon.













# Pincher


















# Willed-Mecha



Willed-Mecha are a population of Automata who are not capable of generating their own belief and altering their therium core. These creatures have perceived free will. Approximately thirty percent of all Automatons are Willed-Mecha and they are most commonly found in the city of Delta and Scender. The vast majority of Willed-Mecha serve military or labor purposes of some sort.


























# Gov'Doran

Steel Jungle, Snowforest

[[Anthros]] and [[Zothros]] mainly. Prey are the sheep of society. Predators are the decision makers. predator and prey disagree due to [[Primalism and Advancism]]. delicate balance in society.

The Class that governs Gov'Doran is called [[Yevnijn Tres]]



Gov'Doran has a large betting and Huma fighting scene (Huma Resonant as well, but never any other type of creature without consent to participate),  fighting as well as a mixed martial arts traditional competition called [[Snofut]]. Essentially, it is a 1v1 unclothed fight to the death in a snowy environment, where you can't throw any strikes or kicks on the inside of the body. This means all attacks must come from the left or right of the individual. The only exception is if a hand is touching the ground, you can throw a kick in any direction. All attacks must come from the left or right. Grappling can occur at any time and punches can be thrown on the ground. The fighters have an incredible use of torque and power, being able to change direction with ease through momentum. You may not poke the eyes, bite, but you may headbutt, and hit in the groin. For this reason, many serious fighters get castrated. These fighters are extremely battle hardened and respected.

Snofut has two types of competitors, predator or prey. In a predator vs predator match, it is a 1v1 duel as mentioned. In a prey vs prey match, it is a relay race. In a predator vs. prey match, it is a game of tag where the predator has to try and catch the prey and bring him into submission, there is no striking in this event, only grappling.

People in Gov'Doran smoke a lot

Gov'Doran has a strong education system reliant on building a strong and versatile military oriented society. Being in the military is an extremely respected position. Very fit, intelligent, tactical, prideful of their government.

The Gov'Doran are very resilient due to facing constant wars and surviving in their homeland. They are also a very funny people, due to being in constant wartime, humor as an art became extremely popular as a coping mechanism. Comedians (and generally artists) are a respected people. The Gov'Doran people tend to criticize a lot, anything to make someone laugh. This tends to offend a lot of people, but deep down the Gov'Doran people mean no harm, it is simply their culture. There is complete free speech. 

Whenever there has been conflict within Gov'Doran, a common enemy has always appeared to turn the attention of the people. It tends to be the youth that try to break this tradition, effectively dividing the people by trying to promote change. This is do to the nature of free thinking and education which appeals to change. The people are generally very happy following wartime, and are very productive during wartime, as they tend work as a unit. However, due to ideas of Primalism and Advancism, the population is becoming polarized.


Gov'Doran has feigned liberty, but are ultimately ruled by the Chain of Delta's power on the continent of Wyldere, excluding the [[Sable Mountain Range|Sable Region]]. 





# Sable Mountain Range

Southeast Wylderan Mountain Range. There are two sides, one side which is reminiscent of the black forest in Germany, while the other side is a rolling hill grassland.

### The Velspir Range

The Velspir Range is the southernmost region of the Sable Mountains known for its thick veil of fog. This veil is repelled by [[Belief#Spheres of Belief|belief spheres]] but restrict [[Toman Passive Surges (DM Version)]] from occurring. 















# Belief Pool
_Conviction_

**Bin**: [[Scape]]  
**Eco**: [[Toman Ecoss]]

In the [[Toman Ecoss]], every living creature emanates a belief pool, sometimes also described as one's Conviction, from their [[Common Anatomy#The Core|Core]]. These pools are a crucial aspect of existence, reflecting the complex interplay of perception, belief, and interaction in the Scape.

Nature of Belief Pools

- **Formation**: Belief pools gradually develop as a result of perceptual intake and cognitive processes throughout a creature's life. They are shaped by both internal convictions and external influences, creating a dynamic and evolving aura.
    
- **Spherical Aura**: In the [[Soul Fields]], these pools manifest as perfectly spherical auras. Although invisible in the material plane, they can be sensed by those proficient in the study of belief and anima.
    
- **Extension of the Mind**: A belief pool acts as an extension of a creature's mind, embodying the beliefs and perceptions that define their existence and interactions.
    

Interaction with Spira

- **Feeding**: In the Soul Fields, Spira are drawn to belief pools, feeding on the aura of belief generated by the individual's core. This interaction sustains the Spira and enhances the presence of the belief pool in the material plane.
    
- **Anima Generation**: As Spira feed on the belief pools, they generate anima, further strengthening the creature's capabilities and connection to the environment.
    

Effects on the Environment and Minds

- **Environmental Influence**: Belief pools can subtly alter the environment, causing changes like vibrant plant growth, flickering lights, or minor weather shifts. Overlapping belief pools can create larger disturbances, such as [[Belief Delusions]].
    
- **Perceived Power**: A creature's perceived power is often reflected in their belief pool. The stronger the belief in a creature's power, the more palpable their pool becomes, allowing others to sense their strength.
    
- **Mental Influence**: Belief pools can affect the minds of nearby individuals, causing feelings of awe, fear, trust, or discomfort based on the nature of the beliefs surrounding the creature.
    

Potency and Duration

- **Cumulative Influence**: The potency of a belief pool increases with the strength and consistency of the beliefs it absorbs. The longer a creature is perceived in a particular way, the more their pool reflects that perception.
    
- **Ritual Reinforcement**: Significant events or rituals can reinforce a belief pool's influence, making it more pronounced and impactful on the environment and interactions.
    

Stability

- **Dynamic Equilibrium**: Belief pools maintain a dynamic equilibrium, constantly adjusting to changes in perception and belief. This fluid nature allows them to adapt and influence the surrounding world.
    
- **Resilience**: Despite their fluidity, belief pools are resilient structures, capable of enduring challenges and maintaining their influence even in changing circumstances.
    

Role in Society

- **Social and Cultural Dynamics**: Belief pools play a significant role in the social and cultural landscapes of Toma. They influence how individuals are perceived, affect community cohesion, and subtly alter the physical environment over time.
    
- **Navigating Complexity**: Understanding and leveraging belief pools is essential for navigating Toma's complex social interactions, as they shape perceptions, relationships, and power dynamics.
    

Role in Gameplay

- **Sensing Power**: Players can sense a creature’s potential through their belief pool, providing insights into their capabilities and intentions.
    
- **Social Interactions**: The perception of others can influence social dynamics, with strong belief pools eliciting reactions such as reverence, intimidation, or distrust.
    
- **Environmental Changes**: The cumulative effect of belief pools can alter surroundings, subtly shaping the environment to reflect prevailing beliefs.













# Soul Fields

**Bin**: [[Scape]]  
**Basin**: [[Sacrus]]  
**Eco**: **Soul Fields** of **[[Toman Ecoss]]**

The **Soul Fields** is a vast and ethereal plane within the **[[Toman Ecoss]]**, serving as the primary realm where **[[Spira]]** and **[[Nesa]]** exist and interact. This plane is integral to the cycle of life, death, and rebirth, acting as the medium through which souls transition and beliefs are manifested into the world.

Terrain

The terrain of the Soul Fields bears a resemblance to that of the living Toman Planes, but with distinct differences influenced by the unique nature of this spiritual realm. The landscape is shaped by the condensed essence of **[[Soul Anatomy]]**, creating an environment that is fluid and ever-changing.

The terrain within the Soul Fields is not fixed; it shifts and evolves based on the perception of creatures in the living planes. This shifting nature is akin to a fog of war, where the boundaries and shapes of the terrain expand or contract according to the belief and perception of the beings that interact with it. For example, if a creature with weak vision perceives the Soul Fields, the area within their limited sight is the extent to which Spira can sense belief within that region.

Function and Dynamics

The Soul Fields serve as the primary domain for Spira, who reside here until they are released by **[[Never]]**, the Arbiter of Souls, into the control of **[[Behinyu]]**. Behinyu then directs them to interact with the living Toman Planes. The plane acts as a reservoir of souls, where they await the flow of **[[Anim]]** to guide them towards new lives or to influence existing beings in the material world.

Influence on the Living Planes

The Soul Fields have a profound influence on the living planes, especially in how they interact with the flow of belief and anima. Spira within the Soul Fields can affect the dreams, actions, and beliefs of living creatures, subtly guiding them or, in some cases, directly intervening in their lives. The perception of the Soul Fields by the living beings directly impacts the shape and scope of this plane, making it a dynamic and responsive environment.

The Role of Nesa

Nesa, powerful entities within the Soul Fields, play a crucial role in maintaining the balance between life and death. They oversee the movement of Spira and ensure that the flow of souls is aligned with the natural rhythms of the universe. The presence of Nesa adds a layer of complexity to the Soul Fields, as they can exert their influence over specific regions or Spira, shaping the plane in accordance with their will.

Connection to the In-between

The Soul Fields are intricately connected to the **[[In-between]]**, the medium through which creatures of the Toman Ecoss interact with the Imaan Planes and other realms. The In-between serves as the conduit for Spira to travel between the Soul Fields and the living planes, carrying belief and anima across the different layers of existence.

Legacy and Significance

The Soul Fields are a cornerstone of the Toman Ecoss, ensuring the continuity of life and the preservation of belief. As a realm where souls congregate and transition, the Soul Fields embody the eternal cycle of existence, influencing the material world and shaping the destiny of all creatures within the Scape. The dynamic nature of this plane reflects the ever-changing beliefs and perceptions of the living, making it a crucial element in the balance and harmony of the Toman Ecoss.



[[Afterfate]]
















# Spira

**Bin**: [[Scape]]  
**Basin**: [[Sacrus]]  
**Eco**: [[Soul Fields]] of [[Toman Ecoss]]  
**Kingdom**: **Spira**

**Spira** are a fundamental kingdom within the **[[Toman Ecoss]]**, representing the souls that exist on **[[Scape (TTRPG)/1 Purpose Taxonomy/Complete Taxonomy/02 Eco/01 Toman Ecoss/02 Toma/Toma]]** and across the **[[Scape]]**. They are the lifeforce and essence of all living beings, playing a crucial role in the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. Spira permeate the fabric of existence, influencing the physical, spiritual, and metaphysical realms.

### Origin and Nature

The Spira kingdom is composed of souls that exist both within and beyond the Toman Ecoss, spreading across the entirety of the Scape. These entities serve as the foundational material of the great dimensional basins, powering all forms of existence. Every living creature houses a Spira, which is released from its physical form upon experiencing a **[[Spira#Mixture and Solution Death|Mixture Death]]**. The term 'Spira' originated during the **[[Natural War]]** and was used to describe the influence of the dead on the living, as depicted in ancient **[[Natura]]** symbols by early **[[Huma]]** settlers.

### Role and Domain

Spira primarily reside within the **[[Soul Fields]]**, a plane they share with the **[[Nesa]]**. Their influence extends across the Toman Planes, where they guide and shape the beliefs and actions of the living. Spira are also responsible for the generation of **anim**, the vital energy that sustains life and enables the ongoing cycles of creation and destruction within the Toman Ecoss.

### Dreams and Nightmares

Spira influence the dreams and nightmares of living creatures. The nature of these dreams depends on the saturation of belief experienced by the Spira. Starved Spira, lacking sufficient belief, often induce nightmares, especially when a creature attempts to change its beliefs in an unnatural way. Conversely, satisfied Spira, well-fed by strong belief, can lead to pleasant dreams that promote meditative benefits and spiritual growth.

### Perception and Presence

To be a Spira is to be constantly present, perceiving only what is commanded by the flow of anima and belief. The feeling of presence can be slightly altered by a creature's **[[Soul Anatomy#Print|Print]]**. The most powerful print allows a Spira to feel close to nothing, reflecting a state of balance and harmony within the creature's soul.

### Subspira

The Spira kingdom is divided into various Subspira, each representing different functions and characteristics:

**[[Gourmand Spirit]]**  
Gourmand Spirits are demon spirits created when a living creature suffers a death during an intense **[[Merchant System#Source Surge System|Surge]]** of negative belief. These souls died with extreme hatred and became ravenous in their search for belief energy, often manipulating the material world to feed on false beliefs. Gourmand Spira are not imprisoned in Arkon because of their insatiable desire to consume beliefs not attributed to any souls or Nesa in the Soul Fields.

**[[Mindless Spirit]]**  
Mindless Spirits are souls with no beliefs to sustain them, found only in Arkon. These Spira are created through **[[Never]]'s** judgment and are desperate for any belief to end their torment. They consume from any belief sphere they encounter, regardless of its composition. Creatures entering Arkon who cannot manage the anima influx of their belief sphere risk losing all beliefs and becoming an **Asylee**, a living mindless creature.

**[[Outcast and Damned Spirits]]**  
Outcast Spirits are souls trapped in Arkon by their own perceived volition, while Damned Spirits are trapped without perceived fault. The term 'perceived' denotes how Toma's inhabitants view these Subspira, regardless of the **[[Scape (TTRPG)/1 Purpose Taxonomy/Complete Taxonomy/02 Eco/01 Toman Ecoss/02 Toma/Toma#Fated Plane|fate]]** rules present in Toma.

**[[Mimic]]**  
Mimic Spira are resonant with **[[Automata]]** that, while in the Soul Fields, have connected to an object containing **[[Therium]]**. These Spira can appear as attached to objects related to their past life. Mimic Spira are only inherently evil if they are also Gourmand. 

### Interaction with Never

Never, the Arbiter and now a **[[Demon Nesa]]**, plays a vital role in guiding the Spira. He ensures that souls are judged fairly and directed along their appropriate paths, contributing to the ongoing balance of the Toman Ecoss. Through his influence, Never helps to maintain the harmony between the material and spiritual realms, fostering growth and enlightenment for all beings within his domain.

### Influence and Legacy

The Spira kingdom is a defining aspect of the Toman Ecoss, shaping the beliefs, actions, and dreams of its inhabitants. Their presence ensures the ongoing cycle of life and death, guiding creatures toward growth and enlightenment. The legacy of the Spira kingdom is woven into the fabric of existence, influencing the course of history and the evolution of the Toman Planes.

















# Nesa

**Bin**: [[Scape]]  
**Basin**: [[Sacrus]]  
**Eco**: [[Soul Fields]] and [[Imaan Plane]] of [[Toman Ecoss]]

The [[Nesa]] are powerful interplanar deities within the [[Toman Ecoss]], serving as lesser gods who oversee and influence the laws of life, nature, and belief. Their presence is integral to the balance and dynamics of the plane, acting as both guardians and enforcers of cosmic harmony.

Origin and Mythos

In the beginning, when [[Zlellis and O'numeume]] first clashed to form the plane of [[Scape (TTRPG)/1 Purpose Taxonomy/Complete Taxonomy/02 Eco/01 Toman Ecoss/02 Toma/Toma]], their immense cosmic energies formed personifications of the core aspects of their argument. These ripples resonated from the [[Fractal Waters]], where the [[Goda]] dwell, into the [[Sacrus]] and began to form seeds of new divine beings. These seeds slowly grew during the time of the [[Natural War]]. The Goda, intrigued by these nascent entities, later saw an opportunity to further understand their own existence and the nature of creation, as well as find benefits. Once the beginning Nesa were established, the gradient of belief and [[Anim]] had been altered for eternity. Through their existence, belief events became a natural occurrence, when prior to the Nesa there was only one possible event: ascension. Since the Nesa were made in the likeness of the Goda, a wide range of belief events became possible through the core foundations of their planar creation and argument.

Appearance

Nesa are typically seen in their avatar forms, each reflecting the domains they govern and the beliefs they embody. Their forms are highly complex and approaching a completely psychedelic appearance, as they exist within Sacrus, and its spatial dimension, as seen through third dimensional perception (see [[Trenjor and Voyimus#Trenjor|Trenjor]] and [[Spatial Equivalence]]), and are constantly approaching the Fractal Waters. Their forms are often ethereal and otherworldly, embodying the nature of their domains and the cosmic forces they represent.

Fealty

The Nesa are a classification of Nesa who have claimed greater responsibilities from the Fractal Waters through [[Source Surge Types#Nascension|Nascension]]. These responsibilities, once held by the Goda of Toma, have been lifted from them through interaction on the plane, freeing the Goda of responsibility by achieving self-sufficiency on the plane. Each Nesa of Fealty governs specific aspects of life and nature, ensuring the ongoing balance and harmony of Toma.

Nesa of Duality

The Nesa of Duality are lesser gods that embody dichotomous relationships, similar to Zero and One. They often represent opposing forces or concepts, existing within other classifications such as the Nesa of Kingdoms and Nesa of Fealty. The Nesa of Duality include:

- [[Apex and Praeda]] (Predator and Prey)
- [[Trenjor and Voyimus]] (Acceptance and Ignorance/Truth and Falsity)

Nesa of Kingdoms

The Nesa of Kingdoms are deities who represent specific kingdoms within the Toman Ecoss. They embody the essence and characteristics of their respective kingdoms, guiding their evolution and interactions. The Nesa of Kingdoms include:

- [[Chantae]] ([[Celia]])
- [[Never]] ([[Ka'Vit]])

Organization and Relationships

The Nesa operate like a large, dysfunctional family, each with unique personalities and motives tied to their domains. Their complex relationships and interactions often shape the dynamics and events within the Toman Ecoss. While some Nesa work in harmony, others may have conflicting agendas, reflecting the intricate balance of power and influence they wield.

Influence and Legacy

The presence of the Nesa is a defining characteristic of the Toman Ecoss, influencing the evolution and development of the plane. Through their actions and decisions, they shape the course of history and the beliefs of the inhabitants. The Nesa's role as guardians and enforcers of cosmic harmony ensures the ongoing balance and stability of the plane, guiding its inhabitants toward growth and enlightenment.

Subnesa

Nesa are more active during the start of lines. This means they are less active as the line progresses, leading to loss of faith which is typically only restored through line shifts.


















# Wyldere

Wyldere is the northern continent of Toma. Across its northern planar coast ([[Shelf]]) is the [[Summons Mountain Range]] which spans across the entire continent. South of this Mountain Range is mostly sheets of snow

In the Spring and summer, much more of Wyldere is beautiful, green, and full of wildlife. During the winter, however, only the strong survive, which has left a lot of ruins to discover during all seasons. Many uninhabited buildings and chances for encounters.

















# Chain of Delta

**Bin**: [[Scape]]  
**Basin**: [[Sacrus]]  
**Eco**: [[Scape (TTRPG)/1 Purpose Taxonomy/Complete Taxonomy/02 Eco/01 Toman Ecoss/02 Toma/Toma]] ([[Vokar]], [[Wyldere]]) of [[Toman Ecoss]] 
**Kingdom**: [[Huma]], [[Automata]] ([[Willed-Mecha]]), and [[Celia]] ([[Hallid]] and [[Clol]])  
**Phylum**: [[Klesn]]  
**Class**: **Chain of Delta**

**Population**: 8.2 million HR
 
The **Chain of Delta** is a powerful and enigmatic [[Class]] within the [[Toman Ecoss]], ruled by **[[Fuscia Lustin]]**. This totalitarian regime maintains absolute control over the [[Order]] of **[[Delta]]** and its [[Omep Region]]s, where every aspect of life is influenced by Fuscia's cunning manipulation, societal engineering, and the use of various substance distribution to maintain order. The Chain of Delta has also integrated large portions of the [[Celia]] Kingdom, particularly the Subcelia **[[Hallid]]** and **[[Clol]]**, into its governance, using them to spread hysteria and violence to maintain control over the populace.

Structure and Governance

Delta operates under a unique governance structure known as the **[[Chain Triarch]]**, where three regions function independently in the public eye but are in constant communication with one another. The leader of the Triarch, known as the **[[Medan]]**, oversees the entire operation, with **[[Illid Munis]]** acting as the centroid of this triangular formation. The Medan, as the leader, is responsible for securing domestic ties and ensuring that the state's control remains unchallenged.

The Chain of Delta uses this triangular composition of local governments to maintain a firm grip over its citizens. The three regions are not just administrative divisions but are strategically positioned to enforce Fuscia's rule. The Omep regions, particularly, are isolated and heavily controlled, with the military district serving as the only official exit from Delta. This exit is only accessible through granted permission, reinforcing the isolation and control exerted over the population.

The Myth of Stallach

A significant aspect of the Chain of Delta’s control is the perpetuation of the **[[Stallach]]** myth. Stallach is a fabricated historical event used to spread misinformation and promote the leadership of Fuscia Lustin. According to the myth, Stallach was a time when Delta could not properly manage an influx of foreign trade due to an open port, leading to economic chaos and the manipulation of citizenship laws. This narrative serves to justify Fuscia's strict control and the restrictive policies of the state.

However, the true events of Stallach are far more sinister. It was, in fact, a subtle coup designed to overthrow the previous government through a manipulated election. Two of the three Triarch members plotted the assassination of the third Arch, who ruled over the Omep region that has now been transformed into a militarized zone. This leader was replaced with a [[Mimic]] general from **[[Isaheim Maddows]]**’ military, solidifying the power of Fuscia Lustin and his allies. Fuscia ran on a platform that decried the corrupting influence within the Chain of Delta, but this was all part of the orchestration to place him in power, aligning the three Omep leaders under one clandestine government, hidden from the public eye.

MExtrema: Social Panacea

At the heart of Fuscia's control lies **[[MExtrema]]**, a clandestine government program that produces and distributes a wide variety of drugs through seemingly unaffiliated third-party vendors within Delta. This operation serves multiple purposes: fostering addiction to control the population, and identifying individuals who thrive under heavy drug use. These individuals are studied, with the goal of replicating Fuscia’s own ability to manipulate and thrive under substances.

MExtrema is the subject of many conspiracy theories, particularly among dissenters who view it as a key element of the government's deep-seated corruption. The Triarch, the ruling autocrats of the Omep regions, are complicit in MExtrema, using their feigned opposition to bolster Fuscia’s image as the only capable leader. Through subtly flawed campaigns, they create a controlled opposition, reinforcing the legitimacy of Fuscia’s rule.

Military Power and Drug Use

Delta’s military is notorious for its reliance on drug use in combat, making its soldiers unpredictable and formidable. These drugs enhance endurance, aggression, and pain tolerance, giving Delta's military a significant edge. This chemically enhanced force is a cornerstone of Delta’s security, with military service seen as a path to economic stability and social elevation. Families often encourage their children to enlist, knowing that military service brings significant benefits, including financial support for their loved ones.

Economic System and Social Conditions

Delta's economy is highly unstable, with rapid price fluctuations for goods and services. Stores do not have fixed prices; instead, customers must check with **[[Willed-Mecha]]** [[Automata]] workers, who display the current prices on screens embedded in their metallic frames. These Willed-Mecha constructs, designed with a style reminiscent of archaic computing systems, are integral to commerce in Delta, reflecting the society's chaotic economic conditions.

The standard of living varies greatly, with most of the population living in poor conditions, particularly in the Omep regions. The richest area, known as **[[Estal Link]]**, stretches from the port to the city center and is the only region that can engage in both import and export trade. Citizenship in the Chain of Delta is marked by **[[Photometal]]** implants, which not only grant access to Estal Link's open market but also suppress free speech, ensuring that citizens cannot reveal the true nature of Delta to outsiders.

Estal Link: Landing Strip

Estal Link is Delta's facade of prosperity, a region that opens to foreign trade during specific times of the year, as dictated by Fuscia and the Triarch. During these trade periods, Delta presents itself as a thriving, well-ordered city, carefully hiding the corruption and suffering that fuel Estal’s wealth. The Omep regions outside Estal are only allowed to export goods into Estal, sustaining its market. After the trade period ends, Estal closes to outsiders, and Delta's true conditions—marked by exploitation and oppression—remain hidden from the world.

Social Engineering and Control

The Chain of Delta employs extensive social engineering to maintain its grip on power. The mold **[[Clol]]**, used to control and disrupt the population, is released through a complex sewer system designed to target specific areas at specific times. This mold causes infrastructure failures and societal collapse in targeted regions, forcing residents to seek refuge in more prosperous parts of the city. Access to these areas is tightly controlled, requiring government permission obtained through a rigorous process that includes a test and the implantation of photometal beads in the arms. These beads suppress free speech and prevent the spread of the truth about Delta’s condition.

Hallid and Clol: Forces of Oppression

Within the Chain of Delta, the Subcelia **[[Hallid]]** (Yeast) and **[[Clol]]** (Mold) are pivotal to maintaining control over the Order. Collectively known as the **NV** or **[[Novelli]]** by the common people of Delta, these Subcelia are instrumental in enforcing the state’s control. While both are devoted to Fuscia, they have opposing views on how to conduct suffering within Delta. **Hallid** focuses on a slow, creeping form of decay, spreading its influence gradually to create a pervasive sense of dread and inevitability. **Clol**, in contrast, believes in sudden, overwhelming acts of destruction, using its mold to create chaos and fear in a more immediate, violent manner. Together, these opposing forces ensure that the citizens of Delta remain in a constant state of fear and dependency, unable to rise against Fuscia’s rule.

The Slow Path to Perfection

Delta’s progress is deliberately slow, a calculated strategy by Fuscia and the **[[Chain Triarch]]** to maximize the benefits of their citizens' pain without risking the stability of their rule. Progress is made at a pace that allows the government to exploit the population’s suffering for as long as possible. This slow, greedy approach to governance is intended to create a perfect society, but only on the terms dictated by those in power. The benefits of progress are reaped by the elite, while the masses remain in a state of controlled dependency.

The Role of the Klesn Phylum

The **[[Klesn]]** phylum, to which the Chain of Delta belongs, promotes the cleansing of society’s “natural evils.” Within this belief system, drugs are not seen as an evil but as a necessary means of escape from the greater evils of society. **[[Drooga]]**, a sub-kingdom of **[[Automata]]** within the Klesn phylum, consists of drug-related constructs that facilitate this escape. The Chain of Delta's ideology is deeply intertwined with the principles of Klesn, justifying the regime's harsh measures as necessary for the greater good.

The Triarch and the Omep Regions

The Chain of Delta is divided into three [[Omep Region]], each ruled by an autocrat known as the [[Chain Triarch]]. These regions are isolated from Estal Link and are subject to strict government control. The Triarch, who are partners of Fuscia, oversee the implementation of government policies, ensuring that the Omep regions remain subservient to the central authority. The Omep regions, particularly the military district in the east, are heavily fortified and monitored, with access tightly controlled through the use of enhanced photometal beads.

These regions are designed to keep the population in check, with the military district serving as the only official exit from Delta. The Omep regions are where the harshest conditions prevail, with the poorest areas being Rasm in the north and Almalek in the west. The Triarch's role is to maintain order in these regions, using fear, control, and exploitation to ensure that the government’s grip on power remains unchallenged.












For a citizen of Delta to achieve the most amount of freedom (except completely escaping) they must reach Estal Link. This is done when a civilian climbs through a hierarchy starting with [[Almalek]] , then [[Rasm]], then [[Kleznit]]. Once you have served and climbed through all three, you are considered for Estal Link. It is possible to regress back into Rasm from Kleznit, but never will someone return to Almalek once they have escaped.

The photometal implants are upgraded to their strongest belief containment capability before a civilian is released to Estal Link

The name for the Chain of Delta comes from the symbolic idea that the people of Vokar will remain in this land always, as if they were chained down to it by force. This is why from the Illid Munis there are chains reaching towards the three Omep Regions of Delta. These people are battle-hardened and forced to adapt both physically and mentally over time in strange ways, using suffering as a means of climbing to the top of the global food chain. 

Citizens under the Chain of Delta earn their freedoms through the process of climbing through the Omep Regions, in hopes of making it to Estal Link. Almalek is the first region and has the least amount of freedoms. Huma work entirely for the government with no option of specialization in any sense. The only freedom is that of association, causing people to build upon this idea of finding the right group to move you into the next region. The next region of Rasm allows a deeper specialization of career and association, transitioning from consumption-based economy in Almalek to production in Rasm. Then from Rasm to Kleznit, the economy is focused on protection of infrastructure and resources. These resources get funneled into society as fuel. The entire process breeds incredible Huma, some of the smartest, funniest, strongest, and generally most powerful and capable people.

There is no free speech or mind within the Chain of Delta due to Photometal bead implants, however certain things are not impeded by the beads. Cooperation or association is one of them. 

PTSD and other mental health issues are often overlooked, but are incredibly common. Coping mechanisms tend to be very extreme in Deltan people, even after they have made it into Estal Link. This is one of few insights into the entire process, as it is kept under wraps by the government, especially when Delta's market is open.













Death marches are a common tactic used on the plane's [[Shelf]] to minimalize the risk of dissent and the seeking of independence outside the chain.


[[Keane]] are the name for both Zothros and Anthros crow huma resonants that were purposefully evolved to serve as a force of misinformation under the guidance of [[Kee]] and her phylum [[Klesn]]. These crows are seen as truthful by many individuals that believe in the Chain of Delta false advertisements and operations, which pretend to value the lives of the people but really only value the protection of the state and its current power structure. These crow people may work as journalists, graphic artists, or whatever other occupations spreading political propaganda sided with the Chain of Delta's three Omep regions (Each ruled by one of three Archs) or Kee's religious influence. Keane are jingoistic, whereas most inhabitants side with Fuscia, as he is seen as the savior of the common people. Of course, this is not true. This is what Fuscia wants the people to believe so that he is continuously elected and slowly gauges his people with the help of Kee, her Keane, the [[Chain Triarch]], and all the misguided citizens of Delta's regions. The Keane serve as an absorption of natural hatred, in order to misguide the people away from ever revealing the fact that Fuscia could be the orchestrator of the Chain's entire power scheme.

The Chain Triarch serve as scapegoats for Fuscia's public influence, but still benefit from the power scheme immensely, especially when isolated from the people they rule.

Kee has mixed influence over the people, due to her relation to the Keane. Her and the Keane promote self growth through facing hardship head on, which is valuable, however the Keane's public image of promoting the Chain Triarch as well limits the effectiveness of her influence, and instead routes it to Fuscia. Facing hardship head on is a belief of Klesn, due to the societal pollution that the Chain places on its own people to strengthen them and kill off the weak.

From the perspective of the common people, Fuscia is seen as a hero and the only reason why things get better. He is hope. 

An O-Cog is a name for these photometal implants. An O-Cog, over the course of a creature's life becomes less and less noticeable. An O-Cog is most commonly found on the ventral side of the forearm, but can exist in other places depending on the creature.



Chain of Delta public education uses a hierarchal version of social taxonomy, which justifies the actions of their society and state. Scender's version of this is not nearly as hierarchal and has slowly been repealed. Social taxonomy either spread from those who fled or through oral storytelling that managed to survive the [[Cel Blindbirth Line]].








Chain of Delta has unique types of magic present, 
Economic Magic - Focused on influencing value. Resource Magic, Therium Magic
Industrial Magic - Focused on influencing production. Water, Electricity, Pressure, Oil, Fuel, automation, automata, etc.
Political Magic - Backstabbing, accumulating influence, propaganda, power.

Spell idea, 
"You summon 15 sheets of paper, distributed rather evenly, within a mile radius. These papers can be found attached to tavern doors, trees, quest boards, and other similar locations. Each paper contain the exact same information decided by the caster.. Choose up to 25 words to put on this page. This may include up to a single image or drawing, as well as other design explanations if necessary and allowed by the DM."

Upcasting this spell increases the amount of sheets of paper by 15 and the radius by 1 mile."

Chain of Delta requires sheer strength to survive which makes people from this region very mean to each other, willing to do what it takes for oneself and the state to survive. 





Automata in Delta come by the many, as a collective uprising against the regime, whereas in Scender it is one individual automata named Viv who destroys the collective.

# Delta

**Bin**: [[Scape]]  
**Basin**: [[Sacrus]]  
**Eco**: [[Toma]] ([[Vokar]], [[Wyldere]]) of [[Toman Ecoss]]  
**Kingdom**: [[Huma]], [[Automata]] ([[Willed-Mecha]]), and [[Celia]] ([[Hallid]] and [[Clol]])  
**Phylum**: [[Klesn]]  
**Class**: [[Chain of Delta]]  
**Order**: **Delta**

**Population**: 242,000 ([[Omep Region]]) 37,000 ([[Estal Link]])

**Delta** is a technologically advanced yet deeply corrupt [[Order]] within the Toman Ecoss, ruled by the totalitarian regime known as the **[[Chain of Delta]]**. Delta is a society that prioritizes efficiency and productivity above all else, often at the cost of its citizens’ well-being. The state uses **[[Natura]]** to generate electricity, fueling its rapid industrial growth while simultaneously creating pollution pits and other environmental hazards.

Society and Governance

Delta’s governance is heavily militarized, particularly within its three [[Omep Region]] regions, which are ruled by autocrats aligned with **[[Fuscia Lustin]]**. The Omep regions are divided into three sectors, with the poorest sector, **[[Rasm]]**, located at the northern edge of the plane. **[[Almalek]]**, the second poorest, lies to the south and borders the **[[Swirling Sea]]**. The eastern sector is a militarized zone reserved for government and military operations, strictly controlled and requiring enhanced [[Photometal]] implants for entry. This sector also houses one of Delta’s two exits, a heavily guarded route that is only accessible with explicit government permission.

Delta operates a tightly controlled society where citizens must apply for jobs through the government, which in turn dictates their place of residence and social standing. The edge of the plane is used as an artificial border to conserve resources, with the poorest regions forced to live near this inhospitable boundary. **[[Photometal]]** implants are integral to this control, used extensively to track and monitor the population. These implants are taught as a religious rite within the **[[Klesn]]** phylum, symbolizing a ward against societal pollution. In truth, they serve as tools for government surveillance, binding citizens to the state and suppressing any potential dissent.

Estal Link: The Public Facade of Delta

**[[Estal Link]]** is the affluent region of Delta, stretching from the port to the city center, where the **[[Illid Munis]]** is located. This area is the only part of Delta that engages in both import and export trade, with its open market accessible only to those with citizenship in the Chain of Delta. During specific times of the year, usually for a four-month period, Estal Link opens to global trade, presenting Delta as a prosperous and well-ordered city. In reality, the wealth of Estal Link is built on the suffering and exploitation of the [[Omep Region]] regions, which are closed off to outsiders.

MExtrema: The Hidden Operation

A key aspect of Delta’s internal economy and social control is the secret operation known as **[[MExtrema]]**. Under this program, the government produces and distributes various drugs through third-party vendors, who are perceived as unaffiliated with the state. This operation not only controls the population by fostering addiction but also identifies the most successful drug users in society. These individuals are studied to determine the factors behind their success, with the ultimate goal of replicating these traits in others, much like **[[Fuscia Lustin]]** has done with his own drug use.

Military Power and Drug Use

Delta’s military is infamous for its use of drugs in combat, making its soldiers an unpredictable and terrifying force. The drugs administered to these soldiers enhance their endurance, aggression, and ability to withstand pain, giving them a significant advantage over their enemies. This chemically enhanced military force is a cornerstone of Delta’s security, deterring potential threats and maintaining the state’s dominance in the region.

The Hidden Reality of Delta

Beneath the surface, Delta is a society built on deception, control, and exploitation. The power grid, which is seen as a marvel of **[[Fuscia Lustin]]**'s leadership, is actually a product of extreme cruelty towards the **[[Electricity Natura]]**. The leader's public persona, as a champion of progress and innovation, masks the horrific truth of how the city's power is maintained.

This hidden reality is a reflection of the broader themes within Delta—a society that appears to be thriving but is, in fact, rotting from within due to the corruption and moral decay of its leadership.











# Omep Region

**Bin**: [[Scape]]  
**Basin**: [[Sacrus]]  
**Eco**: [[Scape (TTRPG)/1 Purpose Taxonomy/Complete Taxonomy/02 Eco/01 Toman Ecoss/02 Toma/Toma]] ([[Vokar]], [[Wyldere]]) of [[Toman Ecoss]]  
**Kingdom**: [[Huma]]  
**Phylum**: [[Klesn]]  
**Class**: [[Chain of Delta]]
**Order**: [[Delta]] (**Omep Regions**)

The **Omep Regions** are three militarized districts outside of **[[Estal Link]]**, all within the territory of **[[Delta]]**. These regions are heavily controlled by autocrats who are loyal to **[[Fuscia Lustin]]**, each governing their respective sectors with an iron fist.

The three Omep regions are:

- [[Rasm]]: The northwestern and poorest region, bordered by the edge of the plane to the west and the Vok Wall to the north. Rasm is a harsh, desolate area where survival is a daily struggle. The people of Rasm live in extreme poverty, with little access to resources or opportunities. The government’s control over Rasm is absolute, with the region being heavily militarized to prevent any attempts at rebellion or escape. This is the production center of Delta.

- [[Almalek]]: The second poorest region, located to the southwest of the Estal Link and bordered by the ocean to the south. Almalek is ruled by **[[Isaheim Maddows]]**, a necromancer who uses a skeletal military force to maintain control. The people of Almalek live in fear of Isaheim and his undead soldiers, with many having resigned themselves to a life of oppression and despair. This region maintains agricultural and resource-harvesting requirements.

- [[Kleznit]]: The northeastern Omep region, reserved for government and military operations. This area is strictly controlled, with access granted only to those with 3rd level **[[Photometal]]** implants. The Military District houses one of Delta’s two exits, a heavily guarded route that is only accessible with explicit government permission. This region serves as the nerve center of Delta’s military power, with its soldiers being heavily drugged and conditioned to obey orders without question.

The Omep regions are a stark contrast to the wealth and prosperity of the [[Estal Link]], with the people living under constant surveillance, control, and fear. The government's use of [[Photometal]] to track and monitor the population ensures that no one can escape their grip.










# Rasm

**Bin**: [[Scape]]  
**Basin**: [[Sacrus]]  
**Eco**: [[Scape (TTRPG)/1 Purpose Taxonomy/Complete Taxonomy/02 Eco/01 Toman Ecoss/02 Toma/Toma]] ([[Vokar]], [[Wyldere]]) of [[Toman Ecoss]]  
**Kingdom**: [[Huma]]  
**Phylum**: [[Klesn]]  
**Class**: [[Chain of Delta]]  
**Order**: [[Delta]] (**Rasm**)

**Rasm** is the northernmost and poorest of the **[[Omep Region]]** within the **[[Chain of Delta]]**. Located at the edge of the plane, Rasm is a desolate and inhospitable area where survival is a daily struggle. The people of Rasm live in extreme poverty, with little access to resources or opportunities. The government’s control over Rasm is absolute, with the region being heavily militarized to prevent any attempts at rebellion or escape.

Rasm is a harsh and unforgiving place, with the people living in constant fear of the government’s repressive tactics. The government uses **[[Photometal]]** implants to track and monitor the population, ensuring that no one can escape their grip. The people of Rasm have little hope for a better future, with many having resigned themselves to a life of oppression and despair.

# Kleznit Advance

The Kleznit Advance, or the Imperial Army of Delta, is heavily inspired by the Roman Praetorians.

Their clothing is inspired by the variation depicted in the movie Gladiator, with a slight twist relating to Kee. Due to the relation to Klesn and Kee, black and dark purple feathers adorn the armor and clothing as well, specifically around the neck similar to black leather straps.

Fuscia’s imperial armor is very similar, but instead of purple, is a darkened royal fuscia, separating him from the government, in order to subtly influence followers into believing he stands on his own against the official government. It is a symbolic choice, used to weave a consistent lie (mislead the public) seen in many other aspects of this society.







# Drooga

**Bin**: [[Scape]]  
**Basin**: [[Sacrus]]  
**Eco**: [[Scape (TTRPG)/1 Purpose Taxonomy/Complete Taxonomy/02 Eco/01 Toman Ecoss/02 Toma/Toma]] ([[Vokar]], [[Wyldere]]) of [[Toman Ecoss]]  
**Kingdom**: [[Automata]] (**Drooga**, [[Willed-Mecha]])

**Drooga** are a specialized sub-kingdom of **[[Automata]]** within the **[[Klesn]]** phylum, designed specifically for the distribution, regulation, and enhancement of drug-related activities within the **[[Chain of Delta]]**. Originating from construct factories in the **[[Rasm]]** **[[Omep Region]]** of **[[Delta]]**, these Automata play a crucial role in the state's control over its population through the strategic use of drugs.

Function and Purpose

The primary function of Drooga is to facilitate the state's drug-related operations, particularly those tied to the **[[MExtrema]]** program. They are responsible for the production, distribution, and administration of various substances designed to manipulate the minds and bodies of Delta's citizens. These Automata are integral to maintaining the social order within Delta, as they ensure the widespread availability of state-approved substances while also monitoring and regulating the effects of these drugs on the population.

Design and Capabilities

Drooga are constructed with specialized mechanisms that allow them to process and distribute various substances efficiently. Their designs often incorporate elements that enable them to administer drugs directly to citizens, either through injections, aerosols, or other methods. Some Drooga models are equipped with monitoring systems that track the physiological and psychological responses of individuals, ensuring that the desired effects are achieved and maintained.

Additionally, Drooga are often deployed in environments where drug use is prevalent, such as within the ranks of Delta's military or in areas heavily influenced by the state's social engineering efforts. Their presence is a constant reminder of the state's control over the populace, reinforcing the idea that drug use is not only accepted but encouraged as a means of coping with the harsh realities of life in Delta.

Role in the Klesn Phylum

Within the broader context of the **[[Klesn]]** phylum, Drooga serve as the physical manifestation of the phylum's teachings on the management of society's "natural evils." They embody the belief that drugs are a necessary tool for maintaining social order and that the state's control over these substances is essential for the stability and prosperity of Delta. Drooga are seen as both protectors and enforcers of this ideology, ensuring that the population remains compliant and dependent on the state's provisions.

Societal Impact

The impact of Drooga on Delta's society is profound. They are not just machines but symbols of the state's power and the inescapable nature of its control. By normalizing drug use and integrating it into the fabric of everyday life, Drooga help to perpetuate the Klesn ideology, reinforcing the belief that escape from societal evils is only possible through state-sanctioned means. This creates a population that is both physically and psychologically dependent on the state's offerings, further entrenching the power of the **[[Chain Triarch]]** and the regime of **[[Fuscia Lustin]]**.

Evolution and Adaptation

As Delta continues to evolve, so too do the Drooga. New models are constantly being developed to address the changing needs of the state, whether that means adapting to new forms of drug distribution, enhancing their monitoring capabilities, or incorporating more advanced methods of control. The ongoing development of Drooga ensures that the state remains at the forefront of societal manipulation, using technology to maintain its grip on power in an ever-changing world.






# Fuscia Lustin

_Ring Leader, Corvi's Shadow, Medan of Delta_  

_"Curiously, people resist the noble aspects of their shadow more strenuously than they hide the dark sides. To draw the skeleton out of the closet is relatively easy, but to own the gold in the shadow is terrifying."_

- **Class**: **[[Chain of Delta]]**
- **Essa**: **Michael's Soul**

Summary

**Fuscia Lustin** is the calculating and unrevealed **[[Monstra]]** leader, or **[[Medan]]**, of the **[[Chain of Delta]]**, a totalitarian regime in the **[[Toman Ecoss]]**. Known as the "Ring Leader," Fuscia maintains control over the open economic borders of **[[Delta]]** to the foreign world, inviting those seeking power, wealth, or escape. This title reflects the **[[Swirling Sea]]**, which encircles **[[Arkon]]** and is the primary path for powerful nations to enter the Chain's territory. Fuscia’s leadership of this class is marked by advanced technology, societal manipulation, and a relentless desire for control.

The Ring Leader

Fuscia’s public persona is one of command and authority, enhanced by his carefully constructed appearance. His insecurity about his height, hidden behind height-enhancing shoes, drives him to eliminate anyone who uncovers this secret. This detail, among many others, exemplify the lengths Fuscia will go to maintain his image of dominance.

Governance and Control

Fuscia rules Delta through a mix of drugs, psychological manipulation, and advanced technology. His **[[Bloodstream Gauntlet]]** allows him to inject substances into his body, adjusting his mental and physical states instantly. He conceals his **[[Monstra]] [[Purpose Marking]]** on his left hand with a glove, while wearing another glove on his right to hide the absence of a **[[Huma]]** Purpose Line.

Fuscia heavily influences Toma's primary means of travel, the **[[Swirling Sea]]**, which brings wealth and people to the city seasonally. His closest ally is **[[Kee]]**, the only crow in the Toman Ecoss. This crow is a direct challenge to **[[Corvi]]**, who seeks to claim her for the **[[June Preserve]]** and his own **[[Ascension]]**. Fuscia and Kee’s bond is built on greed and power, making them formidable adversaries for the **[[Sea Level Party]]**.

MExtrema and Secret Operations

At the heart of Fuscia’s control lies **[[MExtrema]]**, a clandestine government program that distributes drugs through seemingly unaffiliated vendors. This operation serves multiple purposes: fostering addiction to control the population, identifying individuals who thrive under heavy drug use (just as Fuscia has mastered), and using them as models for societal manipulation.

The leaders of Delta's Omep regions feign opposition to Fuscia, but they are complicit in the MExtrema operation. Their flawed campaigns strengthen Fuscia’s dominance, ensuring his iron grip on Delta remains unchallenged.

The True Color Conflict

When the **[[Sea Level Party]]** confronts Fuscia about his deepest secrets, his facade of control and professional demeanor will break during the **[[True Color Conflict]]**. In the grand Art Hall of **[[Illid Munis]]**, Fuscia will reveal his true nature, abandoning his Fuscia-colored appearance for his true form—rich velvet green, a manifestation of pure malevolence that directly opposes **[[Corvi]]**’s innate goodness. This moment becomes the climactic battle between the Sea Level Party and Fuscia, marking a turning point in their story.

Fuscia's transformation during the True Color Conflict exposes the depth of his corruption and malevolent influence, making him the most dangerous antagonist within Delta and one of the most formidable figures in the Toman Ecoss.








Fuscia got his name from the color of a wildflower in Vokar.

# Automata

**Bin**: [[Scape]]  
**Basin**: [[Sacrus]]  
**Eco**: [[Scape (TTRPG)/1 Purpose Taxonomy/Complete Taxonomy/02 Eco/01 Toman Ecoss/02 Toma/Toma]] of [[Toman Ecoss]]

The Automata [[Kingdom]] represents a unique blend of technology and spirituality within the [[Toman Ecoss]], distinguished from other kingdoms by their origin from [[Therium]], a [[Hollow Resource|Hollow Resource]]. Unlike other kingdoms created by [[Zlellis and O'numeume]], the Automata were crafted by the hands of [[Huma]], embodying the ingenuity and creativity of their makers.

Origin

The Automata arose from the Huma's technological advancements and the discovery of Therium. As a kingdom not directly crafted by Zero and One, the Automata hold a unique position within the Toman Ecoss, representing the potential of creation through belief and technology rather than divine intervention.

Construction

Automatons are constructed, not born, requiring a vessel to house [[Therium]] of some sort. These vessels vary widely in form and function, often designed to enhance locomotion, perception, and anima circulation, but any structure capable of holding a Therium core can serve as a vessel. The process of constructing an Automata involves careful crafting and infusion of belief, allowing the vessel to become a sentient being.

Therium Core

The core of every Automaton is made of refined Therium, allowing for the storage and generation of belief. With the right vessel, an Automata can generate its own belief through anima-powered mechanical perception, mimicking biological senses. The Therium core functions as the brain of the Automaton, and when sealed to reject new beliefs, it allows can restrict the Automata's free will, creating a distinguishment between [[Willed-Mecha]] and [[Free-Mecha]].

Fate Worse than Death

Automata face a unique vulnerability: their Therium core must remain intact to preserve consciousness. If the vessel is destroyed or separated from its core, the Automata loses all senses but retains consciousness and memories, leading to a potential eternity of paralysis without a new vessel. This represents a fate worse than death for an Automaton, trapped within its own thoughts.

# Klesn

**Bin**: [[Scape]]  
**Basin**: [[Sacrus]]  
**Eco**: [[Scape (TTRPG)/1 Purpose Taxonomy/Complete Taxonomy/02 Eco/01 Toman Ecoss/02 Toma/Toma]] of [[Toman Ecoss]]  
**Kingdom**: [[Huma]]  
**Phylum**: [[Mohrsmünt]] (**Klesn**)

**Klesn** is a **[[Phylum]]** within the Toman Ecoss, deeply intertwined with the political and social structure of the **[[Chain of Delta]]**. Originating from the totalitarian society of Delta, Klesn is unique in its structure, with its leadership rooted not in a traditional human figurehead but in the enigmatic presence of **[[Kee]]**, the crow companion of **[[Fuscia Lustin]]**. Kee, not Fuscia, is the true leader of Klesn, guiding the spiritual and religious aspects of the phylum while Fuscia handles the political governance.

Leadership and Role of Kee

Kee is revered within Klesn as the spiritual leader who guides the growth of the religion. Her presence provides the people of Delta with a reason to endure their suffering, framing it as a necessary path to spiritual enlightenment and societal stability. Through Kee’s influence, the religion is tightly controlled by the state, ensuring that the population remains loyal and subservient to the regime. Kee’s guidance is seen as divine, and her connection to Fuscia allows her to weave religious teachings into the fabric of Delta’s social order, creating a powerful system of control that blends the spiritual with the political.

Core Beliefs

Klesn teaches that societal pollution—such as addiction, poverty, and corruption—is a natural evil that must be managed by the state. This belief is used to justify the Chain of Delta's totalitarian rule, with the leadership positioned as the only force capable of addressing and cleansing these evils from society. The phylum promotes the idea that efficiency, control, and the suppression of dissent are necessary to maintain a stable and prosperous society.

Photometal implants are central to this belief system. Taught as a religious rite, these implants are said to bind beings together against societal pollution, creating a ward against falling into evil. In reality, these implants are a means for the government to spy on and control the populace, collecting and monitoring citizens' beliefs and thoughts to ensure loyalty.

The Role of Cleansers

A key component of Klesn is the **Cleansers**, who act as political priests responsible for maintaining the purity of society. Cleansers address a wide range of issues, including addiction, pollution, infrastructure problems, and even ideological dissent. They manipulate Photometal bead implants to accrue false respect and enforce control over society. Cleansers are highly respected figures within the Chain of Delta, seen as essential to the functioning of society and the preservation of order. They are often involved in public ceremonies where they ritually "cleanse" areas of society, reinforcing the belief that these problems are natural and must be continually managed.

Reactionary Origins

Klesn emerged as a reactionary phylum to **[[Asceptim]]** following the invention of the Airship by the Asceptim society. The sudden appearance of this advanced technology caused widespread fear within the Chain of Delta, as it represented a significant shift in power and the potential for external influence over Delta's isolated society. Fuscia capitalized on this fear during his campaign, rising to power by promising to protect Delta from the perceived threats posed by Asceptim and other external forces. Klesn was formed as the ideological backbone of this campaign, focusing on the need for strict control, efficiency, and the management of societal evils to preserve Delta's way of life.

The Leader as the Central Figure

In Klesn, while Kee is the spiritual leader, Fuscia Lustin plays a crucial role as the political Medan of Delta. He is seen as the embodiment of Klesn's ideals, revered not only for his leadership but also for his ability to maintain control over the natural and social evils that threaten society. Fuscia’s governance, combined with Kee’s spiritual guidance, creates a dual leadership that reinforces the Chain of Delta’s power.

The leader is constantly re-elected, a process that is heavily influenced by the state's control over media and public perception. These elections, while appearing legitimate, are carefully managed to ensure that the leader remains in power. This system is justified by Klesn as necessary for the stability and survival of society.

Societal Impact

Klesn's influence permeates every aspect of life in the Chain of Delta. The phylum's teachings justify the state's control over the lives of its citizens, with the leader positioned as a benevolent figure who protects the people from the dangers of societal pollution. The emphasis on efficiency and control has led to a society that is highly organized but also repressive and intolerant of dissent.

The belief that societal pollution is a natural evil has led to the widespread acceptance of state intervention in all aspects of life. The Cleansers play a crucial role in this, as they are seen as the agents of the leader's will, working to maintain the purity of society. This has created a culture where the people are dependent on the state for their well-being, and where the leader is seen as indispensable to their survival.

Legacy and Influence

Klesn has had a profound impact on the development of the Chain of Delta, shaping it into a highly controlled and efficient society. The phylum's teachings have reinforced the state's power, making it nearly impossible for dissent to take root. The leader's central role in the phylum has ensured that his influence extends to every corner of society, making him both revered and feared by the people.

As a phylum that places its power in a single leader rather than a deity, Klesn represents a unique approach to governance and belief within the Toman Ecoss.

Summary

Kee is the only crow in the entirety of the [[Toman Ecoss]], a unique and singular entity within the realm. She is a creature of significant importance, not just for her rarity but also for the pivotal role she plays in the power struggle between [[Corvi]] and [[Fuscia Lustin]]. As a member of the [[Ferra]] Kingdom, Kee belongs to the [[Klesn]] phylum, a classification that highlights her odd nature and strange connection to the [[Chain of Delta]].

Description

The Last Crow

Kee is a striking figure, embodying the archetype of the crow with an added air of mystery and profundity. Her feathers are a deep, iridescent black that seems to absorb the light around her, giving her an almost ethereal presence. Her eyes, keen and intelligent, shimmer with a dark wisdom, as though she holds secrets that have been long forgotten by the world. Despite her otherworldly appearance, Kee is known for her bossy demeanor, asserting her dominance over all except for Fuscia.

Role in the Chain of Delta

Kee’s existence is tightly bound to the [[Chain of Delta]], where she resides under the care of [[Fuscia Lustin]]. Within this harsh and manipulative environment, Kee represents a beacon of enigmatic power. Fuscia’s possession of Kee is a deliberate act of defiance against [[Corvi]], who seeks to claim the crow for his [[June Preserve]]. The presence of Kee within Delta not only highlights Fuscia’s dominance but also serves as a constant reminder of the unresolved tension between the two powerful figures. Kee and Fuscia share a cold, heartless bond, unified in their profligate and greedy endeavors. They are both antagonists to the [[Sea Level Party]], with Kee often playing a direct role in Fuscia's schemes.

The Klesn Phylum

As a member of the [[Klens]] phylum, Kee is part of a lineage of creatures that exist on the periphery of reality, straddling the line between the physical and the metaphysical. The Klesn are known for their connection to shadows and the unseen forces that influence the Toman Ecoss. Kee, as the only crow, embodies these traits with an intensity unmatched by any other creature.

Significance and Influence

Kee’s significance extends beyond her rarity. She is the final piece in Corvi’s grand design for the [[June Preserve]], the last [[Ferra]] needed to complete his collection and potentially trigger his ascension. However, her bond with Fuscia complicates this plan, creating a web of intrigue and conflict that could have far-reaching consequences for the entire Toman Ecoss.

In many ways, Kee is more than just a crow; she is a symbol of the delicate balance of power within the Toman Ecoss. Her existence challenges the status quo, and her fate is inextricably linked to the destinies of those who seek to control her. As an antagonist to the [[Sea Level Party]], Kee’s presence is a constant threat, her cunning and ruthless nature making her a formidable opponent.






Kee has a Huma avatar that is an evil woman based upon everything about my past (SAM) relationships. She is anxiety, she is conformity, she is deceptive of Fuscia, but he falls for it. She wants to claim all that Fuscia produces, as he is a man simply capable of more in society.




















# Corvi

**Bin**: [[Scape]]  
**Basin**: [[Sacrus]] (Bo/Corvi) and [[Fractal Waters]] (Corvi)  
**Eco**: [[Toman Ecoss]] (Bo/Corvi) and [[Godan Ecoss]] (Corvi)  
**Kingdom**: **[[Huma]]**  
**Essa**: **Michael's Soul**

**Corvi**, originally named Bo, is a deeply influential and enigmatic figure within the **[[Toman Ecoss]]** and the **[[Godan Ecoss]]**. Born as a Huma, Bo lived among the earliest Huma societies, experiencing the full spectrum of life, loss, and the passage of time. His journey is marked by extraordinary resilience and an evolving understanding of existence that has shaped the very fabric of the Toman Ecoss.

Origin as Bo

Bo was born into the early Huma societies, where he lived and grew alongside his people, forming bonds, creating memories, and experiencing the world as they did. However, Bo's fate was unlike that of his fellow Huma. The **[[Goda]]** **[[Zlellis and O'numeume]]**, fearing the loss of Corvi to a **[[Mixture and Solution Death#Solution Death|Solution Death]]**, made their first Fealty to a **[[Nesa]]** named **[[Lucille]]**. This Fealty ensured Bo's immortality within Toma, granting him the power to live on indefinitely unless he himself chose to kill the Nesa, Lucille. This act of preservation was driven by the Goda's desire to save Corvi, recognizing his unique potential and significance.

The Pain of Immortality

As Corvi lived on, he faced the unimaginable pain of outliving everything and everyone he had ever known. He watched as his loved ones, his friends, and entire civilizations succumbed to the natural cycle of life and death, while he remained. This relentless cycle of loss became a crucible of suffering that tested Corvi's resolve and sanity. Over time, he confronted his own inner demons, struggling to accept the harsh realities of the natural universe.

Transformation into Corvi

Through centuries of hardship and introspection, Corvi eventually came to terms with the truth of death and the nature of the universe. This profound acceptance and the wisdom he gained from his experiences transformed him into the figure known as Corvi. The name "Corvi" was a nickname he chose for himself, feeling it resonated more with his identity and the journey he had undergone. This new name symbolized his growth and his increasing connection to the **[[Fractal Waters]]** and ultimately to **[[Swehel]]**, as his powerful **[[Crea]]** continued to draw him towards these higher dimensions.

The Influence of Art

Instead of imposing his presence upon the world, Corvi has chosen a path of subtle influence. He produces a variety of artwork—comics, children’s books, and other forms of media—that are distributed across Toma and beyond. This art is intentionally created to lead by example, offering wisdom, moral questions, and explorations of character that inspire others to consider their actions deeply. Corvi avoids idolization, knowing that the purity of his messages is best preserved through anonymity. His work is accessible, rooted in a cohesive style that combines fantasy and traditional 1900s cartoon influences, appealing to all ages and perspectives. Through his creations, Corvi has built a quiet legacy, where his influence on society emerges naturally from his art rather than his power or identity.

The Crow and the June Preserve

Corvi’s influence is most visible in the **[[June Preserve]]**, where he has gathered nearly all kingdoms of the **[[Toman Ecoss]]** as part of his grand preservation design. However, there is one crow that eludes his grasp, held in the possession of **[[Fuscia Lustin]]**, Corvi's Shadow, within the **[[Chain of Delta]]**. This lone crow is the final key to Corvi’s ascension, and its recovery is of utmost importance to him. The tension between Corvi and Fuscia over this crow adds a layer of complexity to their already strained relationship.

The Creation of the Preserve and Influence on Preservus

Corvi's deep understanding of life and death led him to create his first preserve within Toma, a sanctuary where he sought to protect and nurture the creatures and ecosystems he had come to cherish. This act of preservation was so impactful that it is said to have sparked the belief in **[[Preservus]]**, a **[[Phylum]]** that values the preservation of life and the careful management of natural resources.

Legacy and Philosophy

Corvi’s influence reaches beyond personal power; he is deeply aware of the responsibility and limitations that come with his unique existence. Through his actions, he seeks to impart a quiet, meaningful legacy. His art embodies his philosophy: leading not through command but by encouraging self-reflection and growth. This hands-off approach defines Corvi’s philosophy, for he believes that genuine change arises from within individuals and societies, not from mandates or interventions imposed from above.

Later (C.L) he will converse with Celia, who convinced him that he was necessary for their purpose. Thus, he actually went through with it in trust that he would be reborn, following the flames from the oil Fuscia Lustin sprayed in an attempt to kill him.

# MExtrema

**Bin**: [[Scape]]  
**Basin**: [[Sacrus]]  
**Eco**: [[Scape (TTRPG)/1 Purpose Taxonomy/Complete Taxonomy/02 Eco/01 Toman Ecoss/02 Toma/Toma]] ([[Vokar]], [[Wyldere]]) of [[Toman Ecoss]]  
**Kingdom**: [[Resonant]]  
**Phylum**: [[Klesn]]  
**Class**: [[Chain of Delta]]

**MExtrema** is a clandestine and highly secretive operation within the **[[Chain of Delta]]**, orchestrated by **[[Fuscia Lustin]]** and his autocrats. This operation plays a pivotal role in maintaining the totalitarian control over Delta’s populace and ensuring the stability of Fuscia’s rule.

Purpose and Objectives

MExtrema serves multiple strategic purposes within Delta:

1. **Social Control**: The primary goal of MExtrema is to maintain control over [[Delta]]’s population by fostering widespread addiction. Through the distribution of a wide variety of drugs, the operation ensures that large portions of the populace remain dependent on substances that dull their senses, inhibit their critical thinking, and make them easier to manipulate.
    
2. **Research and Development**: MExtrema is not just about control; it is also an ongoing research project. The autocrats, in collaboration with Fuscia, study the effects of different drugs on the population, particularly focusing on individuals who manage to thrive despite heavy substance use. These successful drug users are carefully monitored and studied to understand the factors behind their resilience, with the aim of replicating these traits in others. This research is driven by the desire to replicate Fuscia’s own ability to manipulate and thrive under various drug-induced states.
    
3. **Controlled Opposition**: The operation is also used as a tool to manipulate public perception and reinforce Fuscia’s leadership. The autocrats, who appear to be opponents of Fuscia in public, are actually complicit in MExtrema. They run flawed political campaigns designed to subtly fail, thereby strengthening Fuscia’s position and portraying him as the only leader capable of guiding Delta through its challenges. This controlled opposition creates the illusion of a functioning democracy while ensuring that all power remains firmly in Fuscia’s hands.
    

Distribution and Secrecy

The drugs produced under MExtrema are distributed through third-party vendors who are seemingly unaffiliated with the government. These vendors operate under the guise of independent dealers, allowing the government to distance itself from the operation and avoid direct blame for the widespread addiction. However, these vendors are carefully monitored by the state, ensuring that they adhere to the objectives of MExtrema.

The secrecy surrounding MExtrema is tightly controlled, with only the highest-ranking members of the Chain of Delta aware of its full scope. The operation is shrouded in conspiracy theories, with dissenters suspecting its existence but unable to prove it. This uncertainty further destabilizes any potential resistance movements, as the true nature of MExtrema remains elusive.

Impact on Delta

MExtrema has a profound impact on Delta’s society. The widespread addiction it fosters leads to a populace that is both controlled and demoralized, with little capacity to resist or question the government’s actions. The operation also contributes to the ongoing social and economic instability within Delta, as the government’s focus on maintaining control through addiction diverts resources away from infrastructure and public welfare.

Moreover, MExtrema plays a crucial role in Delta’s military strategy. The drugs developed and tested through the operation are also used to enhance the capabilities of Delta’s soldiers, making them more formidable and resilient in combat. This chemically enhanced military force is a key factor in Delta’s dominance in the region and its ability to suppress internal dissent.

Legacy and Influence

MExtrema represents the dark underbelly of Fuscia’s rule, a testament to the lengths he and his autocrats are willing to go to maintain their power. The operation’s legacy is one of corruption, control, and manipulation, shaping Delta into a society where addiction is not just a social ill, but a tool of governance. The influence of MExtrema extends beyond Delta’s borders, as the operation’s research into drug use and social control continues to inform the tactics used by the Chain of Delta to maintain its grip on power.

**Isaheim Maddows** is a necromancer and autocrat of Delta, ruling over the largest and second-poorest [[Omep Region]] region known as **[[Almalek]]**. Isaheim is a twisted individual who believes in death and violence as a proper solution to most problems, largely due to his ability to resurrect creatures. He is known for resurrecting the people he falls in love with,  after manipulating and disposing of them in cruel and sadistic ways

Isaheim maintains control over **[[Almalek]]** using a skeletal [[Mimic]] military force. These undead soldiers are not particularly strong individually, but their numbers and Isaheim’s control over them make them a formidable force. The military force is concentrated between the city and the ocean, effectively cornering the population and preventing any chance of escape or rebellion.

Isaheim’s rule is marked by fear and oppression, with the people of **[[Almalek]]** living under constant surveillance and control. His use of necromancy and his sadistic tendencies have made him one of the most feared figures within the **[[Chain of Delta]]**.

This is the weakest army in Delta.

The people of Almalek live in fear of Isaheim and his undead soldiers, with many having resigned themselves to a life of oppression and despair.

Almalek is a harsh and unforgiving place, with the people living in constant fear of the government’s repressive tactics. The government uses **[[Photometal]]** implants to track and monitor the population, ensuring that no one can escape their grip. The people of Almalek have little hope for a better future, with many having resigned themselves to a life of oppression and despair.

**Phylum**: [[Klesn]]  
**Class**: [[Chain of Delta]]
**Order**: [[Delta]]
**Family**: [[Chain Triarch]]
 

**Stallach** is a mythicized event within the history of the **[[Chain of Delta]]**, often cited as a cautionary tale about the dangers of uncontrolled foreign influence and the importance of maintaining strict societal order. According to the official narrative perpetuated by the regime, Stallach was a period of economic chaos that nearly brought Delta to its knees due to the mismanagement of an open port and the resulting influx of foreign trade. This tale has been deeply woven into the cultural memory of Delta’s citizens, serving as a justification for the extreme isolationist policies and rigid control enforced by **[[Fuscia Lustin]]** and the ruling **[[Chain Triarch]]**.

The Official Narrative

In the state-sanctioned version of events, Stallach occurred during a time when Delta’s leadership allowed unprecedented access to foreign traders through an open port. The economic boom that followed led to a surge in property purchases by outsiders, destabilizing the local economy and causing widespread unrest. As citizenship laws were manipulated by these foreign interests, the native population began to suffer, and social structures crumbled under the weight of rapid change. The government, overwhelmed and unable to cope with the sudden shifts, nearly lost control, leading to a period of lawlessness and despair.

This version of Stallach is used as a historical precedent to justify the Chain of Delta’s strict control over trade, citizenship, and the flow of information. It reinforces the idea that outside influence is inherently dangerous and that only through the strong, centralized power of Fuscia Lustin and the Triarch can Delta maintain its stability and prosperity.

The Hidden Truth

Beneath the myth lies the true story of Stallach, a narrative of political intrigue, betrayal, and a calculated coup. The real events of Stallach were orchestrated by two of the three Triarch members, who plotted to overthrow the existing government through a false election. This election was rigged to ensure the assassination of the third Arch, who was the leader of the Omep region that would later be transformed into a militarized zone.

This leader was replaced by a **[[Mimic]]** general from the military forces of **[[Isaheim Maddows]]**, a notorious figure known for his control over skeletal armies and his deep ties to the dark underbelly of Delta’s governance. The coup was designed not only to eliminate a potential rival but also to consolidate power within the Triarch, paving the way for Fuscia Lustin’s rise to dominance.

The narrative of Stallach as a period of foreign-induced chaos was fabricated to conceal this power grab and to frame Fuscia Lustin as the savior of Delta. By portraying the event as a near-catastrophe caused by external forces, the regime was able to implement harsh restrictions on trade and citizenship, tightening their grip on the population while erasing the true story of the coup from public memory.

Impact and Legacy

The myth of Stallach continues to shape the governance and policies of Delta to this day. It serves as a key piece of propaganda, reinforcing the need for the Chain of Delta’s strict, isolationist policies and the centralization of power under Fuscia Lustin and the Triarch. The event is commemorated annually in a state-sponsored ritual that emphasizes vigilance against foreign influence and the importance of maintaining the purity and security of Delta.

In truth, Stallach represents one of the most significant turning points in Delta’s history—a moment when the balance of power shifted irreversibly in favor of the current regime. The true story, hidden beneath layers of propaganda and misinformation, is known only to a select few, ensuring that the legacy of Stallach remains a tool of control in the hands of Delta’s rulers.
