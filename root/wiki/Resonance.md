# Resonance

Resonance is the fundamental phenomenon by which the kingdoms of [[Toma]] interact, overlap, and influence one another. In the context of the Toman Ecoss, resonance describes the natural, spiritual, and biological processes that allow traits, energies, and functions to pass between kingdomsâ€”sometimes resulting in hybrid or entirely new forms of life. The study of resonance is central to understanding the interconnectedness of all living things in Toma, as well as the emergence of unique beings such as [[Resonant|Resonants]] and polyresonant creatures.

## Scientific and Mystical Study

Resonance is both a scientific and mystical concept. It encompasses:
- The transfer and blending of traits between kingdoms (e.g., Huma, Monstra, Automata, Natura, Bluma, Ferra, Spira, etc.)
- The emergence of hybrid forms (see [[Resonant]])
- The creation of new ecological and spiritual relationships
- The foundation for many myths, legends, and magical phenomena in Toman culture

## Types of Resonance

- **Simple Resonance**: The interaction between two kingdoms, resulting in hybrid or resonant forms (see [[Resonant]] for examples).
- **Polyresonance**: A rare and powerful form of resonance where a being develops significant traits from three or more kingdoms. Polyresonant creatures, such as [[Alwa]] and the [[Primordial|Primordials]], are legendary for their abilities and influence. For a list of known polyresonant entities, see [[Resonant#Polyresonance]].

## Importance in Toman Ecoss

Resonance is the engine of change and adaptation in the Toman Ecoss. It drives evolution, spiritual transformation, and the creation of new life. Scholars, mystics, and naturalists alike study resonance to better understand the balance and potential of the world.
